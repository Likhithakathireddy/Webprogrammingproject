ABSTRACT Experimental data for the determination of superheats of separately, fission fragments and fast neutrons in water were taken with an experimen- (2) tally modified set up of Bell: Attempts to correlate both data from present work and from Bell with theory led to apparent inadequacies with the theory. The theory is based on an ""Energy Balance Method"" developed by Bell. This method was also used to compute threshold superheat for (5) benzene, for later comparison with data from another investigator when this reference becomes available. Application of this Energy Balance Method to predict fission neutrons induced nucleation and alpha particles induced nucleation (alpha particles from (n,x) reaction on Boron) at Pressurised Water Reactor conditions indicated that radiation induced nucleation for monoenergetic neutrons and alphas present in reactor may be effective in causing initiation of nucleate boiling. However, detailed consideration of all neutron energies present (spectrum) was not accomplished to arrived at a definite conclu- sion for this reactor case. Thesis Supervisor Neil E.

The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information in normal English dialog. It uses semantic information and context to understand discourse and to disambiguate sentences. It combines a complete syntactic analysis of each sentence with a ""heuristic understander"" which uses different kinds of information about a sentence, other parts of the discourse, and general information about the world in deciding what the sentence means. It is based on the belief that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can ""understand"" the subject it is discussing. The program is given a detailed model of the knowledge needed by a simple robot having only a hand and an eye. We can give it instructions to manipulate toy objects, interrogate it about the scene, and give it information it will use in deduction. In addition to knowing the properties of toy objects, the program has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carry them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, and asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through use of context and physical knowledge. In the programs, syntax, semantics and inference are integrated in a ""vertical"" system in which each part is constantly communicating with the others. We have explored several techniques for integrating the large bodies of complex knowledge needed to understand language. We use Systomic Grammar, a type of syntactic analysis which is designed to deal with semantics. Rather than concentrating on the exact form of rules for the shapes of inguistic constituents, it is structured around choices for conveying meaning. It abstracts the relevant features of the linguistic structures which are important for interpreting their meaning. We represent many kinds of knowledge in the form of procedures rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns. By developing special procedural languages for grammar, semantics, and deductive logic, we gain the flexibility and power of programming languages while retaining the regularity and understandability of simpler rule forms. Each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, and can call on any other piece of knowledge in the system. Thesis Supervisor: Seymour A. ?apert Title: Professor of Applied Mathematics']"

ABSTRACT In this study, two basic tasks have been considered. The first of these was the development of the mathemati- cal model simulating a cargo transportation interface in which the cargo is to be transported from a ship moored at some dis- tance from the shore to point A on a beach where no port facil- ities are available. The transferring of cargo from the ship to the shore is accomplished by means of transfer vehicles, such as amphibious craft. The cargo transfer from the ship to the transfer vehicles is accomplished by ship-based unloading gear, such as ship-based cranes. The cargo transfer from the transfer vehicles at the shore is accomplished by beach-based unloading gear, such as fork lifts. The second of these was the selection of the solution method that would permit the analysis of such a mathematical model. Importance was attached to the condition that the sol- ution method should enable the user to gain an insight into the unloading procedure and thence to correctly derive the optimum use strategies in the ship-to-shore transfer analysis. The method chosen was that of computer digital simulation be- cause it not only provides the user with the necessary in- sight, but also allows the user to solve the problem at hand without the need for the introduction of drastic simplifica- tions into the mathematical model, as would certainly be re- quired by any of the known optimization techniques. As a further means of enhancing the usefulness of our methodology, the concept of antithetic variance was introduced into our solution procedure. (Antithetic variance is the means by which the user may exercise the underlying [stochastic] math- ematical model the minimum number of times in order to esti- mate the necessary results with a prespecified degree of con- fidence.) Because digital simulation is employed as the solution method in almost all congestion problems, it follows that antithetic variance may also be used profitably in models other than the one in this study. Guidelines for the user have therefore been included, wherein the expected usefulness of the concept of antithetic variance (as developed here) in its application to congestion problems in general is indicated.

The single-degree- of-freedom inertial gyro is taken as the example, but the study can be easily applied to other types of gyros and other engineering devices. The nonlinear mathematical model is derived in a digital computer program format. A unique set of basic cost data was obtained, mainly from industry, and used in determining the characteristics of the model. Those parameters of the model which indicate the greatest life-cycle cost sensitivities are investigated. Areas where the return in terms of lower life-cycle costs may be greater than the investment are identified. Thesis Supervisor : Walter Wrigley: Sc.

IONIZATION IN SEEDED DETONATION WAVES by Satyaki Basu Submitted to the Department of Mechanical Engineering on September 30, 1959, in par- tial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Science ABSTRACT It has been reported that equilibrium ionization is achieved in about 20 microseconds behind oxy-hydrogen and oxy-acetylene detonation waves (1), and that the electrical conductivity of the gas behind the detonations is of the order of 10-3 mhos/cm. To obtain magnetohydrodynamio interaction with reasonable magnetic fields, conductivities of the order of 10 mhos/cr are required of combustion gases. This thesis reports on an investigation of oxy-acetylene detonations at 1/10 atmosphere initial pressure, which were seeded with Potassium Acetylide (C,HK) to obtain the high conductivity mentioned above. Finely ground Potassium Acetylide was injected into the initial mixture and the concentration of the resulting aerosol was determined by a sedimentation technique. The electrical conductivity was determined by a magnetohydro- - dynamic interaction method developed by Lin et al (4) The measured conductivities were plotted as a function of the mole per cent of Potassium added and compared with the re- - sults of thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. Predicted and measured conductivities have approximately the same dependence on the concentration of Potassium, which was varied from 0.1 per cent to 10 per cent. Absolute values agreed within a factor of two, the agreement improving with increasing mole fraction of Potassium; an extrapolated value of 10-15 sq cm being used for the electron-gas collision cross section in the calculation of the conduc - tivity. There is some uncertainty in this value, and a value twice this gave good agreement between theory and experiment. The maximum measured conductivity was 2.7 mho/cm and occurred at about 3 mole per cent Potassium in the product gases. Thesis Supervisor: J. A.

Raff Submitted to the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering on May 21, 1960, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Shipping and Shipbuilding Management. The world oil tankship industry has a decided history of severe cyclical behavior. The object of this thesis is to investigate the nature and causes of such quantitative behavior. It is realized that such behavior stems from the basic organizational relationships and management decisions in the various parts of the industry. It is further realized that such behavior is fundamentally dynamic in charac- ter, and therefore the method of investigation used is industrial dynamics. In this method, a mathematical model is built up from descriptive knowledge of the causal relationships and functions exist- ing in the situation under study. A model was formulated which included seven sectors, covering most of the considered significant interactions and determinants of behavior. The role of expectations in the decision-making process was incorporated. The model simplified from the real world in many instances, and is based on certain assumptions stated. In spite of the simplifications, assump- tions, and omissions, the behavior of the model, as shown in computer results, is in general quite reasonable compared to what would be expected in the real world. It has thus been shown that industrial dynamics is not only a valid tool for this investigation, but can yield highly rewarding results. It is concluded that the new tanker ordering decisions are extremely important in stimulating the cyclical behavior. These decision rules should be revised further to improve the reasonableness of system be- havior. Time did not permit this author to proceed in this direction beyond an outline of the very next steps involved. The model presented herein can serve as a foundation structure upon which to develop more fully this area of investigation, and as a guide in such development. It is hoped that further work is carried out towards gaining a sounder understanding of the tankership market cycles. Thesis Supervisor: Jay W. Forrester Title: Professor of Industrial Management']"

The program of the competition presented the customary requirement for a modern European administra- tion building of a representative rather than commercial character: namely, the partition into small office cells, all of which must receive direct daylight. The height of the construction was limited to approximately ten stories (131.23 feet) above the ground level. On April 15-18th the entries were judged. Three of the designs submitted were spot-lighted and honored with prizes (See Appendix V). All of these three prize-winning design proposals attemped to meet the require- ments only in the customary way, using the long, flat-box building form, 100 to 140 meters long ( 328.08 to 459.32 feet), ten stories high, and composed of individual cells, organized in a double-loaded corridor Bystem. We know that this type of designing is not based on consideration of three dimensional relationships, but upon 3 the system of mere mathematical sequence. The site is not a part of the composition nor blended in with the total design. The site is treated like a step-child; it becomes something left over once the ground plan of the building has been cut out. Theoretically, this giant-type of administration design was developed to conserve valuable ground in badly congested areas of cities. But now these monsters are also appearing out in the green countryside. Apparently many people see nothing detrimental in bringing such build- ings into the country, although they were originally develop- ed to suit completely different circumstances. Now they are marring the free space outside the cities, standing there with no relation to their surroundings, shutting off the natural beauty of the landscape, in this case, the Swiss Alps, the beautiful mountain pastures, and Lake Geneva. Is it either necessary or proper to design the new Headquarters of the WHO to be such a conventional box? Are there not social implications in technology that makre questionable the universal use of such purely technical products a.s these office buildings? Are we not dealing here with a conformiet pattern which fails to consider problems of city planning or of human nature? It is the purpose of my Thesis to examine the content and value of this currently popular pattern of 4 architecturel thinking as shown in the WHO competition, to indicate the possibilities of interpreting the administration building for the World Health Organization from a different point of view, and to support this interpretation by a counter propossl.']"

Abstract In the first chapter the preliminaries of the theory of Hopf algebras are presented. The notion and properties of the antipode are developed. An important filtration is induced in the Hopf algebra by its dual when the Hopf alge- - bra is split. It is shown conilpotence and an algebraically closed field insure a Hopf algebra is split. The monoid of grouplike elements is studied. In the second chapter conditions for an algebra A -- which is a comodule for a Hopf algebra H --to be of the form A 711 B H (linear isomorphism) are given. The dual situation is studied. The graded Hopf algebra associated with a split Hopf algebra decomposes in the above manner. Chapter III contains the cohomology theory of a commutative algebra which is a module for a cocommutative Hopf algebra. There is extension theory and specialization to the situation the Hopf algebra is a group algebra. Chapter IV is dual to chapter III. Chapter V is devoted to coconnected cocommutative Hopf algebras, mostly in characteristio p > 0 . There, the notion of divided powers is developed and shown to charac- terize the coalgebra structure of a class of Hopf algebras. The Hopf algebras are shown to be extensions of certain sub Hopf algebras by their primitive elements. Thesis Supervisor: Bertram Kostant Title: Professor of Mathematics']"

M. EL-SHIEKH Submitted to the Department of Mechanical Engineering Fibers and Polymers Division, on May 14, 1965 in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Science in Mechanical Engineering This investigation is directed toward an improved under- standing of the mechanisms and actions taking place in the textile twisting process. During conventional twisting, material is fed into the system at a constant rate and in the form of a flat ribbon, composed either of continuous filaments or short discontinuous fibers such as cotton or wool. Upon passing the delivery point, the ribbon is continuously twisted into a compact yarn structure. During twisting, the different filaments comprising the ribbon compete for the central position in the yarn structure. The difference in fiber path lengths between inner and outer yarn layers leads to tension variation between the fibers and this, in turn, causes a continuous change of fiber position along the yarn length. The mechanism of this fiber interchange, or migration, was studied theoretically and experimentally. It was found that in open structures outward migration occurs when predetermined slack develops in the pretwist zone. In closed structures, outward migration occurs when the central fiber buckles compressively against the surrounding fiber matrix. The experimentally measured migration frequencies agreed well (within 10-20%) with the theoretically predicted values. -ii- Further downstream in the twisting zone the newly formed structure whirls around a rotating spindle in a twisting balloon. Twist distribution in this zone was analyzed, taking into consideration geometrical effects coupled with the torsional and bending rigidities of the yarn. Twist variation across both the twisting element (traveller) and the yarn guide (pig tail) was also computed. The resulting prediction of yarn twist distribution was verified by measurements using high speed photography on a specially constructed model twisting unit. The twist distribution along the yarn and, in particular, the twist level developed at the point of yarn formation, affects not only the fiber migration pattern but also the overall efficiency of the twisting process. In this critical region the yarn was found to have approximately 60% of its final twist. It is essential that the fibers are twisted here at such a rate as to provide cohesive strength capable of withstanding the tensions arising from the rotating balloon. The interactions between yarn twist and strength and twist versus tension in the twisting oper- ation were considered in detail. A method for predicting yarn breakage on the basis of these interactions is proposed. In addition to the above-mentioned actions involved in twisting, several secondary effects were considered. They include twist variation with ring rail motion; fiber drafting in the twisting zone; and the changing geometry of the twist triangle. The study focuses on important yarn structural effects which relate to twisting conditions and it leads to several suggestions for process improvements which should be considered in current mill practice. -iii-']"

ABSTRACT An attempt has been made to generate, automatically, a thermodynamic network, from the measuring of the required data to the final calculation of thermodynamic properties. Based on a study of available instrumentation, an experimen- tal system is proposed that will measure volumetric data, to an accuracy of about 1.0 per cent, for a gas, by means of a mass and volumetric flowmeter. A computor program was written that will calculate a thermodynamic network from the data measured in the proposed experiment. It is also possible to use the computor program to calculate a thermodynamic net- work from volumetric data already in the literature. In order to check the accuracy of the computor pro- gram in treating experimental data, the thermodynamic proper- ties of nitrogen were calculated, and compared with the thermodynamic properties of nitrogen existing in the litera- ture. It was found that good agreement was achieved when volumetric data of 0.1 to 0.01 per cent accuracy were used as input to the computor program. The results calculated in this work were compared with three other sets of results. When comparisons are made with each set of results, there are no significant differences. Some of the thermodynamic properties that were calculated and compared were the enthalpy, entropy, constant pressure heat capacity, fuga- city coefficient and Joule-Thomson coefficient. The thermodynamic properties of nitrogen were also calculated from volumetric data that had a random error of 1.0 per cent, and from volumetric data that were rounded to only two significant figures. In each instance, the result- ing thermodynamic properties of enthalpy entropy and heat capacity were compared with the corresponding properties cal- culated from volumetric data with no purposely introduced error. In both cases the agreement was good. The differ- ences found in the comparisons were of the same order of magnitude as the differences found between the various sets of thermodynamic properties found in the literature. This would indicate that errors of about 1.0 per cent in the volumetric data do not have a significant influence on the calculated thermodynamic network. By combining the proposed experiment with the com- putor program that was developed, it is possible to generate a thermodynamic network in an automatic manner. Volumetric data could be measured with an accuracy of about 1.0 per cent, and the calculated thermodynamic network would be of sufficient accuracy for most engineering purposes. This could be done much quicker, and with less expense, then has previously been the case. Thesis Supervisors: Robert C. Reid, Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering Charles M.

Attention is centered particularly on the rising and pitching motions of the system and on the establishment of conditions for which ventilation - sudden aeration of the hydrofoil surfaces - is imminent. Derivation of the equations of motion of a hydro- foil system is preceded by preparatory studies of the lift on a hydrofoil near a free surface, the mechanisms of cavitation and ventilation of a lifting hydrofoil, and the pertinent properties of ocean waves. Theories are developed and correlated with analyses of existing experimental data to give relations of design and analytical value concerning the lifting properties and the ventilating characteristics of hydrofoils as affected by their orientation with respect to the free surface. The equations governing the pitching and rising motions of hydrofoil systems are derived in general form. Two basic types are considered: rigid systems using variable area to maintain elevation, and non-rigid systems using incidence control. When the area of submerged hydrofoils is variable these equations are found to contain non-linear terms of the same order of magni- tude as the linear terms. Several preliminary approximate analyses are made of the equations, including linearization and reduction to one degree of freedom. Finally, the method of solving the complete equations for variable- area systems by means of a recently-developed electronic differential analyzer is explained, and the results of approximately 450 solutions are presented with pertinent conclusions. It is found that it is of paramount importance to use the deepest hydrofoils permissible whenever possible, at least as deep as the height of the largest waves to be traversed. The largest possible ratio of boat - length to chord-size and the smallest ratio of radius of gyration to boat-length should be used. It is shown that as the speed of a hydrofoil system is increased, its stability is reduced and its susceptibility to cavitation and ventilation increased, so that careful design of the load distribution on the hydrofoils is of critical importance at high speeds. The transient performance of a hydrofoil sy stem entering a wave near its crest is found to be very much worse than its steady-state performance. The combined effects of increasing speed and of changing direction of travel with respect to the waves are studied for hydrofoil systems of several configurations traveling in waves of varying size and steepness. It is concluded that at moderately high speeds (up to 80 feet per second) a carefully designed rigid hydrofoil system traveling in waves having a height which is less than the running depth of the foils should exhibit good stability and smooth performance. In larger waves the system will probably undergo transient motions of intolerable character. At higher speeds, automatic incidence control may be necessary.']"

A theory of stall propagation in a cascade of airfoils of high solidity has been developed which includes the effects of finite blade chord and of the boundary layer response to changes in angle of attack. The theory is valid for small perturbations in velocity about a mean flow condition with finite pressure rise across the cascade, provided that the pressure fluctuations behind the cascade are much smaller than those ahead of the cas- cade. The solution for the velocity of stall propagation in- - dicates that the velocity increases with the wave length of the stall cell, tending towards a limiting value for very large stall cells. The wave length of the stall cells at the beginning of rotating stall is dependent on the magnitude of the boundary layer time delay. The theory predicts propagation velocities within 25% over a wide range of wave lengths for a stationary circular cascade and a rotating blade row which have been tested.

Pasluy Submitted to the Department of Mechanical Engineering on Docember 17, 1954 in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Science in Mechanical Enginsering. Abstract Calendering is the term applied to the process of rolling bulk plestics into sheets. This process is widoly used in industry for the production of plastic sheets and linoleum. In this process as well as any large-scale industrial process there is always the desire to have a given piece of equip- ment produce the largest amount of its product possible. For this reason an analytical approach to the problem scemed useful. A study of the flow of an elsstic-viscous materinl thet is being calendered is undertaken. The solution of this problem is known for the case of a viscous material. Advantage is taken of the viscous solution to prodict the behavior of an elastic-viscous material whose properties are ""almost"" viscous. The problem is broken into two parts, as follows: 1. is stress-strain rate equation is chosen that can give suitable predictions for simple types of flows while remaining simple enough to work with. This equation is given below. Sij Sij (I+aJz)ey = + 2n 26 Jf = second invariant of the strein rate tensor ei== strain Sij = reduced stress n = viscosity G = shear modulus a = parameter selected to match material in question 2. An approximate solution of the calendering problem is obtnined and calculated results are given to determine the effect of Beveral parameters. (A formal perturbation solution is given in the Appendix.) This solution indicates the effect of elesticity on the calendering of a material which is very close to being viscous. This solution can be used as a guide in selecting suitable speeds of operation for calendering when the material to be calendered exhibits elastic as well as viscous behavior. Thesis Supervisor: E.

Criteria for predicting behavior in limit- ing cases have been established. Oxidation experiments in the systems manganese-carbon, nickel-carbon, tungsten-carbon and titanium-carbon confirmed the theoretical analysis and contributed to the understanding of oxidation of these systems. An auxilliary investigation into the oxidation kinetics of tungsten between 700 and 1000°c revealed the presence of two conjugated oxide layers only one of which is protective. A mathematical formulation of the oxidation kinetics was worked out and found to agree with the experimental data. Initially the oxidation rate is proportional to the inverse square root of the reaction time but as the reaction progresse the rate approaches a constant value and the protective oxide layer approaches a constant thickness.

Reiner Submitted to the Department of City and Regional Planning on May 23, 1955, in partial fulfillment of the requirments for the degree of Master in City Planning. Objectives: The object of this thesis is, first, to determine the sources and the content of certain physical planning principles and to establish on what assumptions and other bases these rest in order to assess these realistically. Secondly, this crit- ical survey was conducted to determine the areas of essential agreement and disagreement so far as these principles are concerned. Procedure: Th e source material was a large segment of the planning lit- erature published since 1895 and concerned wi th the whole range of problems, especially of a physical nature, which characterizes the contemporary urban environment. Given the synoptic nature of the field of City Planning, considerable attention was devoted to proposals for the ideal city. The decision was made to focus on principles of the middle range between the levels of excessive specificity and gene- rality. The critical survey centered on four interrelated areas: 1) The proposals regarding the over-all form of the city, distribution and relationship of use areas within the city, and the place of the city in the larger region, 2) the basic circulation pattern, 3) considerations of optimum size, and 4) the development of density standards. The analysis was presented historically; within the four major periods of the last sixty years, the proposals were studied in terms of five categories of city form. Findings: The development of physical principles, of the whole field itself, shows maturity in their response to real and pressing problems. On the other hand, all too often there has been an unwarranted reliance on simple assertions, preliminary findings or sheer opinions, as well as unsophisticated ex- cursions into alien disciplines in search of principles. A large area of agreement was uncovered. In the literature, one finds the underlying assumption that there is a causal relationship between the sphysical environment on on hand and the social and economic life of the city and its inhabitants on the other. There is, secondly, considerable dissatis- faction with the city's physical arrangement which leads so often to social ills. A city, thirdly, is seen as composed of a hierarchy of units (with definited suggested limits for most of the levels); these units can be employed to im- prove social conditions. The city should also be composed of functionally differentiated areas. Circulation, too, should be'zoned by type, and is said to have uses other than simple motion, too. Disagreement was found on the issue of compact vs. open development and the degree of independence or dependence units of a city should have. The proposals for optimum pop- ulation per unit of a city show a variety of findings, sources, and assumptions. Similarly, many opinions exist on whether total city size should be limited or whether one should plan for growth. Density standards vary too, and often ,like population optima, have social reconstruction bases. Finally, there is the full r ange of form proposals and circulation schemes, each with certain c haracteristic advantages and disadvantages. Thesis Supervisor Burnham Kelly""]"

One of these, obtained with the specimen immersed in 85 per cent ethanol, was indistinguishable from the patterns in the literature of type A. A pattern (designated B3) similar to the B pattern of the literature but exhibiting much more detail was obtained with the specimen immersed in 70 per cent ethanol and held under mild tension. The axial repeat period was 34.2 A and the spacing between helix axes (in a hexagonal array) was 25.2 A. A lattice containing a frequent quantized defect was derived. A pattern (designated B2) resembling the B pattern more closely than the A pattern was obtained from DNA immersed in 85 per cent ethanol and stretched 55 per cent. The axial repeat period was 32.5 A. The specimen was crystalline. Mechanical and optical studies were used to correlate the A to B2 transition observed by X-ray diffraction with the mechanical and optical studies in the literature. Completely reversible 2 fold elongation was observed. A molecular model for DNA in the B3 form was derived. It is in substantially `better agreement with the X-ray data than the Watson and R Crick model. The basic assumptions of the latter are maintained. It was necessary to hypothesize a new configuration for the deoxyribose. In the model the two backbone chains are helically arranged outside the base pairs with 10 residues per 34 A turn. The phosphorus atoms are located on helices of 9.9 A radius axially displaced from each other by 0.4412 turns, The centers of all of the atoms of the base pair (except two hydrogens) are ithin 5.1 A of the axis. Many aids to analysis were developed that will be of use in any structure determination involving nucleic acid, including refinement of optical diffraction technique and instrunentation, a method for taking the water of hydration into account by modifying the weights of the atoms of the main structure, simplification and graphical representation of the diffraction equations, and design of a three dimensional model kit. X-ray difiraction patterns were obtained from DNA stained with acridine orange that exhibited the same type of lattice as that derived for the B3 pattern. The axial repeat was 34 A and the distance between helix axes was 21.4 A. A plausible type of structure was derived for the complex and correlated with the results of com- plexing studies carried out in dilute solution. Denaturation vastly 3 changed the complexing in solution, The results of spectroscopic studies on the complexing of acri- flavine and MgCl2 are reported and data concerning the ""solubility"" of DNA in alcoholic solutions is presented.

Wilmot Submitted to the Department of Chemistry on November 12, 1954 in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy The Raman spectra of x -quartz, vitreous silica and a series of soda-silica glasses from 9 to 44 mole percent Na20 were studied. Quantitative photographic intensity measurements were made. These permitted a comparison of the total intensity of the Raman scattering of quartz with that of vitreous silica, and a study of the band intensities in the glasses as a function of composition. The inter- pretation of the Raman spectrum of quartz differed little from those given in the literature. Frequency and in- tensity distributions in the spectrum of vitreous silica were found to be different from those in the quartz spectrum at frequencies below 500 cm-1. However the total in- tensities of the Raman scattering of the two substances were of the same order. The continuum found in the Raman spectrum of vitreous silica in the range 100 - 500 cm-1 was interpreted to indicate that any microscopic order cannot extend over dimensions larger than a few times the unit-cell size of quartz. it it In the spectra of the soda-silica glasses, the bands associated with the three-dimensional silica network (as found in vitreous silica) decreased progressively in intensity with increasing soda content. Conversely bands associated with various kinds of Si-0- linkages progressively increased in intensity. Frequencies have been assigned to stretching and bending modes of the Si-0- groups. Agreement between the Raman frequencies of the soda-silica glasses and the published infrared frequencies is rather poor. It is not apparent whether this disparity is due to experimental causes or has a more fundamental origin such as pseudo-symmetry which causes strongly Raman-active modes of vibration to be weak in the infrared and vice versa.

Lyon Submitted to the Department of Physics on May 16, 1955, in partial ful- fillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. ABSTRACT In this work we are concerned with the excitation of continuous systems by random noise fields. The excitation is interpreted as the average or mean square displacement, velocity, etc., and is obtained from a knowledge of certain statistical properties of the source. The thesis begins with an historical account of the developing use of the equation of motion with random source terms, the so-called Lan- gevin equation. This equation is then used to calculate the corrolation functions for the system response when correlations of the same order of the source are specified. The formalism is then applied to the finite string for both sta- tionary and moving noise fields. It is found that correlation lengths due to the source and viscosity of the surrounding medium strongly affect the excitation for various wavelengths. As an experimental test a thin metal ribbon is placed in a flowing turbulent field, and its excitation for various values of flow is examined. A qualitative agreement with the predicted results is obtained. The analysis is then applied to infinite strings where the inter- pretation is uncomplicated by the effect of boundaries. Substantially similar results as for the finite string are obtained. If one observes -ii- the excitation of the string as a functinn of wavelength, the effect of corrolation lengths in the noise field is wery striking. The thesis is concluded by an attempt to create the random noise fields assumed previously by a superposition of elementary sources. This superposition creates an ensemble of source functions which may then be averaged over to obtain the source correlation. An attempt to create a representation of the turbulent field by this method completes the work. Thesis Supervisor: Dr. K. U. Ingard Title: Assistant Professor of Physics']"

The models developed treat explicitly density and pattern of growth for residential development. They also provide for industrial and local commeroial development. Space requirements and requirements for municipal facilities are taken from planning and engineering standards and from current experience. The cost data for specific facilities and services are taken from the experience of many cities and towns, and are developed in the light of theoretical and engineering knowledge. Particular attempt is made to distinguish among levels of service provided and to discover economies or diseconomies of scale in providing various municipal services. Yearly costs are computed for several theoretical models for key years throughout the period of growth. All capital and operating costs incurred in the developing area are analyzed, but the analysis does not treat specifically the costs of facilities in the center of town which must be expanded because of the more intensive activity associated with the new growth. Nor does it treat the effect on community costs of the existence of public facilities in the developing area which can serve the new growth. Cost analysis of the theoretical models shows that density has a major effect on costs but its effect is not as great as that of the level of service provided. With the same complement and standard of service, low density growth always costs more than high density growth. However, at. low densities some services can be eliminated without harm to the town (e.g. public sanitary sewers). When these services are not provided, costs of low density development drop below costs for fully serviced medium density developments. In all models, but especially in jump growth models, the cost per capita decreases as the development proceeds. Thesis Supervisor']"

ABSTRACT An analytical investigation of the lateral dynamic behavior of two-truck railway vehicles using steel wheels and steel rails is described. Measures used to assess dynamic performance are maximum stable operating speed and, for a specified rail roughness input, power spectral density of lateral acceleration in the passenger compartment (ride quality) and the RMS lateral tracking error. Static suspension performance is measured by the lateral tracking error produced by steady curving. Linear, lumped-parameter models are used to represent the carbody and trucks. Trucks are modelled as rigid in the plane of the rails. Two models for the carbody are employed: a rigid body with translational and yaw freedom and with a truck at each end, and a translational mass with no yaw freedom and a single truck. The latter model is simpler, and is shown to be a useful approximation to the former in predicting the influence of suspension parameters. Inclusion of yaw freedom introduces further vibrational modes of the carbody which can reduce ride quality or cause instability. Vehicles with conventional rigid trucks, having opposite wheels connectéd by rigid axles, are subject to lightly damped lateral oscillations (""hunting"") which may become unstable even at low speeds. The effects of various suspension parameters on hunting are discussed. An automatic controller is defined to supplement the action of the secondary suspension. Two special cases of the general controller (active steering, and asymmetry in the passive suspension) are examined in detail and both shown to be capable of improving all three measures of dynamic performance significantly; both, however, can degrade steady curving ability. The use of rigid trucks with independently rotating wheels, ground to a concave tread profile to provide guidance, is evaluated and found to be highly beneficial in improving ride quality, and to eliminate the cause of hunting instability. Such trucks exhibit less tracking error due to steady curving at low speeds than do conventional trucks, but more at high speeds. Thesis Supervisor: David N.

ABSTRACT Damping characteristics for the optimum performance of various tasks by the users of knee-leg prostheses are found to be incompatible, which indicates an ultimate need for a damping mechanism which is controlled by the amputee rather than by a state function of a specific task (e.g. cyclical muscle-firing in the stump, or weight bearing of the prosthe- sis, during the walking cycle.) A damping mechanism which will be utilized in a proto- type knee joint to experimentally determine optimum damping characteristics for all phases of the walking cycle and other functions (stairway and ramp negotiation, controlled sitting and kneeling, etc. ) has been designed. Overriding design considerations have been found to be : Damping range from full joint lock to full joint freedom, dynamic response over the damping range to 30 Hz, low power consumption by the actua- tion mechanism, and adaptability to a light weight, low bulk production design. Hydraulic damping, and historical design of prosthetic knees is discussed. The force-balanced poppet 3 valve is introduced, and the prototype valve and actuator design is presented. The prototype double poppet valve design is found to exhibit excellent properties for use in above knee (A/K) prosthetics, but the actuator design does not meet the res- ponse criterion.

A modal approach is used throughout the work for obtaining the mathematical model and control techniques applied. The arm model is represented mathematically by a state space description de- fined in terms of joint angles and mode amplitudes obtained from trunc- ation on the distributed systems, and includes the motion of a two link two joint arm. The problem of controlling the system is examined via the linearized model and using a regulator type of control. Three basic techniques are used for this purpose: pole allocation with gains obtained from the rigid system with interjoint feedbacks, Simon-Mitter algorithm for pole allo- cation and sensitivity analysis with respect to parameter variations. An improvement in arm bandwidth is obtained that could replace more con- servative designs currently in use. Optimization of some geometric parameters is undertaken in order to maximize bandwidth for various payload sizes and programmed tasks. The controlled system is examined under constant gains and using the nonlinear model for simulations following a time varying state trajectory. The procedure presented in this work is general and can be implemented to be used in more specific designs. THESIS SUPERVISOR: Professor Daniel E.

We discuss the relation of this model to judgements about what is being perceived, and to models of visual processes which can be physically tested. We describe the main theoretical concept, stability, both for perception in general and for perception of icons. We illustrate stability by a detailed discussion of a collection of photographs. We develop a mathematical setting in which we can define stability. We then summarize in the stability hypothesis the relation we conjecture exists between the mathematical expression and the underlying intuition of stability. We give a simple computational tool for applying these abstract mathematical structures directly to the study of perception of icons. We point out that our results are consistent with the views of visual artists, they yield a non-trivial classification of types of visual ambiguity, account for a large number of standard ""visual illusions"", and reveal how to construct many more.

We design privacies and what is left over becomes public space, This thesis questions that attitude and suggests that public space be designed a,s a meaningful place for various kinds of positive communal activities, In a section of introductory observations two key issues which make a large contribution to the lack of quality in our public space are discussed. First, there is the mutually exclusive attitude we have toward the realms of public and private, Second, there is the effect of the auto- mobile on small and large scale environmental organization. Comparisons with Italian hill towns are made pointing to correlation between use and physical form. A type of urban organization which stresses high density, low rise pri- vacies, àctive walkways, neighborhoods and mixed use is suggested, Overlap- ping definitions of public and private space are suggested together with an attitude toward public space that it function simultaneously as a path and a place. A context of roadways, patterns of use, and major pedestrian direc- tions is set up on a large scale. At smaller scales an additive vocabulary of edge conditions, privacies, ground level changes, and roadway to walkway relationships is devised to make projections of the nature of the formal implications of this thesis. Public-private edges are defined reciprocally. The public space is defined positively by configurations of private edges, At the smallest scale a vocabulary of stairs, gardens, landings and entrances is developed to state more specifically the nature of implied public-private relationships. The central point of this thesis is to draw attention to the connection between the way a projected environment is to be used and the need to develop a vocabulary of additive form to concretize these patterns of use.

The knowledge of its behavior in molten iron has long been de- sired. Data obtained in industrial operating furnaces involve many variables, and have been of little help in establishing equilibria re- lationships. The present investigation has been undertaken to study the fundamental physico-chemical behavior of chromium in liquid iron under various oxidizing and reducing conditions. To avoid contemination with foreign oxides, chromite and chromic oxide crucibles have been used as containers. A slip-casting method for the manufacture of crucibles from chromic oxide has been success- fully developed. The firing was done at 1430° C in a graphite crucible in a high frequency induction furnace, followed by heating to 1500° C in a globar tube furnace to remove the carbon. It has been found im- possible to get good results by firing in air. The removal of carbon is necessary because it causes excessive porosity of the ingot. During the course of the equilibrium investigation, more than 100 experimental heats have been made at 1595° C + 5° in a high frequency induction furnace under water vapor - hydrogen atmospheres of known compositions. The charge consisted of mixtures of electrolytic iron and electrolytic chromium. Due to film formation on the surface of the melt, equilibria could not be reached from the high chromium side. Some heats, however, have been made with the composition of the charges virtually in equilibrium with the gas compositions to assure that equi- - 2 - libria have been attained. The range of chromium concentration studied was from o to 21.4 percent, and that of the ratio of water vapor and hydrogen in the gas mixture from 1.00 to 0.025. The apparatus for adjusting the gas composition has been carefully tested and found to be satisfactory. A special furnace head of pyrex glass with molten Wood's metal seal has been designed and constructed. A preheater of platinum wire has been used to avoid thermal diffusion of the gas mixture. The results of preliminary runs on the hydrogen- oxygen equilibrium in liquid iron have been checked with previous re- ports of other investigators. Non-metallic crusts have been found in many of the ingots. There were two varieties. By nicroscopic and X-ray diffraction methods one has been identified as the iron chromite, FeO.Cr203, found in ingots containing less than 5 percent of chromium, and the other the chromic oxide, Cr203, found in ingots containing more than 7 percent of chron ivm. From these facts and the study of the equilibrium data, it has been established that iron chromite, or chromic oxide, is the stable solid phase in equilibrium with the liquid iron phase and the water vapor - hydrogen gas phase, when the concentration of chromium in the liquid iron is under or above 5.5 percent and the water vapor - hydrogen ratio is above or below 0.07 respectively. It has been confirmed that iron-chromium alloy in liquid state obeys the ideal solution law; that is, the activity of chromium is al- ways proportional to its concentration, up to at least 21.4 percent of chromium. - 3 - The reactions studied and the values obtained for the equilibrium constant and the standard free energy changes at 1595° C are shown be- low. (1) When chromite is the stable solid phase: FeO-Cr203 (s) + 4H2 (g) = 4H20 (g) + Fe (1) + 2Cr (in Fe) Cr)2 = 7.23 x F° = 26840 cal. (2) When chromic oxide is the stable solid phase: Cr203 (s) + 3H2 (g) = 3H20 (g) + 2Cr (in Fe) = 3 (% Cr) 2 = 1.036 x 10-2 The equilibrium constant of reaction (2) checks very well with (34) that calculated from Maier's equation of free energy change for the reaction Cr203 (s) + 3H2 (g) = 2Cr (s) + 3H20 (g) (36) and Chipman's equation for the reaction Cr (s) = Cr (in Fe) Using Maier's heat data and the value of standard free energy change obtained in this investigation, it has been possible to derive the free energy equations for the following reactions at the steelmak- ing temperatures. Cr203 (s) + 3H2 (g) = 3H20 (g) + 2Cr (in Fe) 1Fo = 93170 - 40.75T - 4 - And 2Cr (s) = Cr203 (s) AF° = -265,010 + 60.32T AH = -265,010 cal. As = -60.32 e.u. The oxygen content in the melt has been found to decrease first and then increase with an increasing chromium content. The minimum oxygen content has been found to be about .029 percent when the chrom- ium content is 6 percent. By defining the activity of oxygen in the melt as equal to the weight percent of oxygen in a pure iron melt in equilibrium with the same gas atmosphere, the activity coefficients, fo = activity/weight percent, have been calculated and found to de- crease very rapidly with increasing chromium content, from 1.00 at o percent to 0.13 at 20 percent of chromium. This effect of chromium on the activity of oxygen might be explained by the assumption of dis- solved chromium oxide in one form or another.

Kienas Committee Chairmen: Dr. Philip Jones & Dr. Richard Salmon Special Education Administration (Abstract) Providing services to handicapped children is more expensive than educating nonhandicapped children. Previous studies have estimated the cost of special education to be approximately twice that of regular education. However, these studies have produced a number of problems in providing accurate cost data including a lack of data at the local level to make meaningful determinations, difficulties in treating shared and indirect costs, problems in making cost comparisons across districts, and variances in the cost of resources over time. This study evaluated the Larson (1985) model, a new methodology for calculating special education program costs, by comparing it to the Rossmiller (1970) model, a widely used method for calculating special education program costs. Judgments were made by comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of each model to the other. Efficiency was appraised by comparing input and process considerations in computing special education program costs in a select school district in Virginia. Effectiveness was appraised by comparing each model's ability to produce comprehensive and accurate special education program costs from the sample school district. Findings indicated that the Larson model had several advantages over the Rossmiller model. First, the Larson model was more efficient as less information from the regular budget was needed to complete indirect cost calculations. Second, the Larson model was more efficient in dealing with shared costs as they could be prorated through the use of a multiplier. Third, the Larson model was considered more accurate in its treatment of related services costs. However, several qualifications needed to be made in judging the Larson model as a better product over the Rossmiller model. Conducting a cost determination was a lengthy process no matter which model was used and is more dependent upon the availability of data in a school district than the model used. Also, both models tended to produce similar cost figures when related services costs were taken into account.""]"

Ward, Chairman Chemistry (ABSTRACT) Models of multiple component, multiple phase adhesives were developed to examine the conflicting demands placed on modern adhesion technology. Styrene and isoprene based block copolymers were investigated in order to understand their adhesive properties. The structure of the microphase separated morphology of the materials studied was found to influence the adhesive behavior in applications as hot melt/structural type adhesives and as pressure sensitive adhesives. The thermal and the dynamic mechanical behavior of linear styrene/isoprene/styrene triblock copolymers (40% and 50% by weight styrene) was determined for free films and for films bonding together two rigid adherends. Damping phenomena indicated a broader mechanical relaxation spectrum occurring at higher temperatures in the bonded assemblies. Microphase separation in the melts of these triblock materials was interpreted as contributing to the formation of residual stresses in both free films and bonded joints under appropriate thermal and pressure histories, illustrating the importance of sample preparation in the evaluation of multiple phase adhesive systems. Surface and bulk physical characterization studies of a series of radial styrene and isoprene based block copolymers (25% by weight styrenic block) were conducted in order to decipher their effectiveness as pressure sensitive adhesives. The chosen materials included polymers based on p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene, (TBS-I)*. p-methylstyrene and isoprene, (PMS-I)*, and finally styrene and isoprene (S-I)* . Such a series was an excellent model system to study in terms of microphase separation-property response. Based on solubility parameter arguments, and supported by dynamic mechanical and thermal mechanical analysis, the polymers based on p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene, (TBS-I)* were the most microphase intermixed of the three systems, while the styrene and isoprene, radial block polymer, (S-I)*, had the highest degree of phase separation, and the p-methylstyrene and isoprene, (PMS-I)*, fell between these limits in terms of degree of delineation of its morphology. In two separate preparations, the three block copolymers were synthesized in a manner which either yielded 100% radial (star) blocks or which combined radial blocks with about 20% of diblock copolymer. Investigations were also conducted on a number of hydrogenated forms of the p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial based block copolymers (25% by weight p-tert-butylstyrene) . Hydrogenation of the isoprene phase converted a reasonably compatible pair of component blocks into a system likely to have a higher degree of microphase separation. The uniqueness of the two sets of investigated polymers lies in the variation of the trade-off between tack and holding power, both necessary for PSAs. Holding power was partially derived from the light crosslinked structure in the isoprene phase, deriving from the radial topology, as well as the development of microphase separation. Tack was related to the compliance of each material. The pressure sensitive adhesive properties of the polymers were found to be closely tied to the final morphology exhibited which was related to the overall compatibility of the component blocks affected by the chemistry of the respective blocks as well as choice of casting solvent. Furthermore, the presence of residual diblock material was found to be an important factor in overall adhesive performance. fracture in adhesively bonded lap shear joints made with rigid substrates (2). Furthermore, extruded films of similar triblock materials used in the fracture study showed different free film storage moduli in the extruded and transverse directions (3). Recent theories, (4,5) indicate that a sharp boundary does not exist in polystyrene-polydiene block copolymers, but rather, partial mixing exists in the interfacial region between the two thermodynamically incompatible phases. The thickness of the interface is temperature dependent. With increasing temperature, intermixing of the two phases increases at the expense of the pure phases, but the copolymers remain phase segregated. Indeed, structural changes continue to exist well into the melt, but the two phase structure of styrene-butadiene block copolymers persists to nearly 180°C (6). At a critical temperature Tc' complete mixing of both phases occurs; the system may be considered as thermodynamically homogeneous. Block copolymers, as a result of the existence of microphase separated morphologies in the melt, exhibit complex rheological properties. Sivashinsky, Moon, and Soong (7) have recently studied the time dependent stress growth and relaxation behavior of SBS systems as a function of casting solvent, temperature, and shear history. Their objective was to provide insight into the mechanism of structure breakdown and reformation in SBS melts. The underlying principal in 44 their investigation was that the rheology of SBS triblock copolymers is highly sensitive to the prevailing morphology. The morphology of the SBS systems, in turn, was found to be highly sensitive to many factors, such as casting solvent, temperature, shear history, and overall sample history. Therefore, rheological measurements may be very difficult to reproduce. Further complexities were found in studies of the stress relaxation behavior, where the morphology of the fluid evolves with time as stresses relax (7-9). Rheology work in our laboratories confirms their observations. Since molten adhesives of the microphase separated type flow into bonding positions and rapidly cool, variable morphologies may exist in almost identically prepared joints. J. M. Widmaier and G. C. Meyer (10) have previously demonstrated that only SIS copolymers with a segregated structure exhibit notable shear adhesive strength. The joint strength was found to pass through a maximum on increase in temperature. Such behavior has been interpreted as depending on the morphology of the copolymers, as discussed above. The maximum corresponds to the temperature just below I C (dependent on by the molecular weights and composition of the copolymers) where the morphology of the sample is favorable for strong bonding. The morphology of the adhesive may be altered by kinetic effects; thus, different cooling conditions (i.e. quenched or annealed) result in bonds of differing lap shear strengths 45 (10) Studies on SIS copolymers in our laboratory also indicate that the presence or lack of pressure upon cooling of a bonded joint produces structures which exhibit different dynamic mechanical damping patterns as will be presented below. Clearly, the history of the adhesive was very important in determining its behavior, pressure included. Some background in this area is important. Densified glasses, prepared by cooling amorphous polymers from the liquid state under elevated pressures, have been a topic of much investigation for the past decade. Currently, three types of properties are usually measured and available in the literature concerning densified glasses: specific volume data, density fluctuation as measured by SAXS, and enthalpy data from DSC measurements. Two different effects appear to result from the application of pressure during glass formation depending upon whether the formation pressure is above or below 1.5 kbar. For pressures less than 1.5 kbar all three of the above properties decrease with pressure, which is indicative of more efficient molecular packing. However, for pressures greater than 1.5 kbar a decrease in specific volume and a relatively constant fluctuation density is observed, accompanied by an increase in enthalpy. Weitz and Wunderlich (11) accounted for the increase in enthalpy at elevated pressures by noting that T g increased with pressure; therefore, the glass prepared under elevated pressure contains chains of higher conformtional 46""]"

The law provided for students in nonpublic schools to receive services commensurate with those received by their public school coun- terparts. This dissertation describes and analyzes the implementation of Title I of ESEA and amendments, in the Catholic Diocese of Richmond, Virginia, from April 1965 through December 1976. The implementation of Title I in diocesan schools resulted in a conflict between church and state. An historical study in church-state relations, this study provides documentation of the conflict and a view of the issues, events and results. Positions of some officials of the Richmond diocese, the Virginia Department of Education, the U.S. Office of Education, and the U.S. Catholic Conference are presented. Three chronological phases of Title I implementation between April 1965 and December 1976 are identified. Efforts of diocesan officials to secure Title I services for children in schools of the diocese varied in concert with events and issues and the personalities of the leaders throughout the time frame. The study documents that the amounts of services parochial school children received were determined, to a large extent, by external factors not under the control of the Richmond diocesan staff. The issues involving the implementation of Title I (now Chapter I, ECIA) remain unresolved. The dissertation suggests the need for future study regarding the implementation of Title I for the period following December 1976. A number of general hypotheses about church and state relationships; about administrative processes in state, federal, and church bureaucracies; and about leadership emerged from the study. These generalizations are presented as empirical proposi- tions.']"

Taylor Chemistry (ABSTRACT) The understanding of liquefaction behaviors, related to a coal's properties and a recycle solvent's composition, is essential for the development of an efficient direct liquefaction process. In this dissertation, a study of the liquefaction behaviors of an Eastern US bituminous and four Western US subbituminous coals is presented. The experimental approach has been to examine their behaviors under various reaction conditions with in-house microautoclave reactor and Kerr McGee pilot plant liquefaction runs. In-house runs involved surveys of coal types and process solvent compositions with variations in reaction times, temperatures and atmospheres. Runs performed at Kerr McGee examined the use of tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) as a process solvent with a Wyoming coal. Liquefaction activities were assessed through determinations of coal conversion to both solvent-soluble products and distillate yields. For the in-house liquefaction studies, a novel microautoclave reactor design and product recovery methods were developed, evaluated and employed. The reaction chemistries of in situ metal species and basic nitrogen heterocycles were investigated specifically. Changes in trace element concentrations were ascertained by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) and Size Exclusion Chromatography/ICP-AES (SEC/ICP-AES). Fates of basic nitrogen components in distillate and solvent-soluble residuum products were examined by nitrogen mass balance determinations, Gas Chromatography/Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (GC/FTIR) and Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). . Conversions to soluble products demonstrated the expected dependencies of liquefaction on coal rank, elemental composition and petrography. The western subbituminous coals showed extreme sensitivity to drying and solvent-soaking pretreatments. Metal content analyses revealed that metals exist as complexed species in the liquefaction process. Higher conversions to toluene-soluble materials were obtained with THQ in contrast to other H-donor solvents. Adduction of THQ was significant in the non-distillate product stream, however. The direct coupling of Reversed Phase HPLC separations with FTIR (RP-HPLC/FTIR) detection through on-line, post-column extraction was developed. Though intended for application to coal-liquefied product (CLP) analysis, this system was evaluated rigorously for both chromatographic and spectral performance. Throughout this investigation, the overall utility of these hyphenated methods for CLP analysis was explored. These methods demonstrated exceptional performance in providing a wealth of qualitative and quantitative information in a rapid manner.""]"

W. Clough, Chairman Civil Engineering (ABSTRACT) The Cone Penetration Test (CPT) was developed originally in Holland in the 1930's as a de- vice which provides a small scale model of a pile foundation. Early versions were simple cone points for which the only measurement was the thrust required to push the point through the ground. Over the past 20 years, the cone was standardized to a tip area of 10 cm², and an electrical version was produced, which allows for continuous measurement of the cone tip resistance and sleeve friction along with a computer based data acquisition system. The electical cone represents a significant step forward for the CPT, since it provides a contiuous profile of information that can be used to identify soil type and define important engineering parameters. More recently, the CPT has shown considerable potential for calculation of settlements of footings on sand, determination of pile capacity, assessment of ground pressures, and evaluation of liquefaction potential for cohesionless soils. Along with the widening application of the CPT, new varieties of cone penetrometers have appeared, with different sizes than the standard. Smaller cones are used for instances where rela- tively small depths of soil need to be penetrated, and larger cones have been developed for pene- trating dense and gravelly soils. With the introduction of the new cones, there has been a tendency to assume that the methods for reducing CPT data for the standard sized cone can be extrapolated to the other sizes of cones. That is, it is assumed that there are no scale effects in cones of different sizes. While this may be true, to date, little direct evidence has been produced to support this view, and the issue is an important one from two points of view: 1. The present data analysis technology is based on that primarily from testing with a standard cone. It is important to know if any changes are needed in this approach, or if the existing methods can be used with confidence for any size cone. 2. If it can be shown that no scale factor exists, then this will allow the use of new, smaller cones in experimentation in modern calibration chambers with the knowledge that the test results are applicable for the cones that are more widely used in practice. The smaller cone offer se- veral advantages in this type of work in that they facilitate the research considerably by re- ducing the effort involved in sample preparation, and they are less likely to produce results influenced by boundary conditions in the chamber. One of the major objectives of this research is to develop an insight into the issue of the scale factor caused by the use of different sizes of cones. This is accomplished through an experimental program conducted in a new large scale calibration chamber recently constructed at Virginia Tech. Many of the latest developments in cone penetration testing have becn forthcoming from testing done in calibration chambers where a soil mass can be placed to a controlled density under known stress conditions. To conduct the experimentation of this work, it was necessary to design, fabricate, and bring to an operational stage a calibration chamber. The Virginia Tech chamber is one of the largest in the world. A significant portion of the effort involved in this thesis research was devoted to this task. In particular, attention was devoted to the development of a system for placement of a homogeneous soil mass in the chamber, and the implementation of a microcom- puter based data acquisition unit to record and process the test results. The scale effects investigation was performed using three different sizes of cone penetrometers in a test program conducted in the calibration chamber. Of the three cones, one is smaller than the standard with a tip area of 4.23 cm², one was a standard cone with a tip area of 10 cm², and one was larger than the standard cone with a tip area of 15 cm2. A total of 47 tests were carried in the chamber using two different levels of confining stress and two different sand densities. The test results show that while a scale factor might exist, the degree of its influence on interpreted soil pa- rameters for a practical problem does not appear significant.""]"

The objective of this research was to apply modern computer and communication technology to influence customer use of electricity in ways that would produce desired changes in the utility's load shape. Peak clipping (reduction of peak load) using direct load control is the primary application of this research. The prototype computerized communication and control package developed during this work has demonstrated the feasibility of this concept. The load management system consists of a network of computers, data and graphics terminals, controllers, modems and other communication hardware, and the necessary software. The network of interactive computers divide the responsibility of monitoring of meteorological data, electric load, and performing other functions. These functions include: data collection, processing and archiving, load forecasting, load modeling, information display and alarm processing. Each of these functions requires certain amount of intelligence depending on the sophistication and complication of that function. Also, a high level of reliability has been provided to each function to guarantee an uninterrupted operation of the system. A full scale simulation of this concept was carried out in the laboratory using five microcomputers and the necessary communication hardware. An important and integral part of the research effort is the development of the short-term load forecast, load models and the decision support system using rule-based algorithms and expert systems. Each of these functions has shown the ability to produce more accurate results compared to classical techniques while at the same time requiring much less computing time and historical data. Development of these functions has made the use of microcomputers for constructing an integrated load management system possible and practical. Also, these functions can be applied for other applications in the electric utility industry and maintain their importance and contribution. In addition to that, the use of rule-based algorithms and expert systems promises to yield significant benefits in using microcomputers in the load management area.""]"

The primary objective of the study was to assess the driver attentional demand required by the navigation system during vehicle operation. A secondary objective of the study was to assess design specifics and determine whether or not the design was optimal in terms of efficiency of use in an automotive environment. Thirty-two driver-subjects drove a specially instrumented 1985 Cadillac Sedan de Ville on public roadways for this research. A cross-section of driver-subjects (both genders, ages 18 to 73, and driving experience from 2,000 to 40,000 miles per year) participated, and a cross-section of roadway types (residential, two-lane state route, and limited-access four-lane) and traffic conditions (light and moderate) were used as part of this research. The driver-subjects were asked to perform a variety of tasks while operating the research vehicle. These tasks included navigation tasks normally performed while using the navigation system, as well as a wide variety of conventional automotive tasks (e.g., tuning the radio or reading the speedometer) normally performed during vehicle operation. The purpose of asking the driver-subjects to perform a variety of conventional automotive tasks was so that direct comparisons in attentional demand could be made between tasks performed daily in an automotive environment and the navigation tasks. Twenty-one performance and behavioral measures were collected and analyzed for this research. These measures included eye-scanning and dwell-time measures, ask-completion-time measures, and a variety of measures indicating driver performance and behavior. The data analyses for these measures focused on two major goals. First, the analyses determined which tasks (both navigator and conventional) required the highest attentional demand. Second, the analyses were used to determine groups of tasks which, for all practical purposes, required equivalent attentional demand. The results of the analyses indicated that the navigation system is a relatively effective device, useful for its intended purpose. The results also indicated that a number of design improvements are required, however, to optimize the safety and efficiency of the device. An iterative process of design improvement and further research into the effects of improved design on required attentional demand is therefore recommended.']"

Gunter F. Donald Bloss, Chairman Geological Sciences (ABSTRACT) Refractometry is a means to measure the refractive indices of liquids, gases, and dielectric solids, either isotropic or anisotropic, by observation of light refraction or reflection with a micro- scope, refractometer or other more specialized equipment. For anisotropic solids, refractometry by total reflection (RTR) is by far the simplest, most rapid, and precise method to determine the refractive indices, provided a polished surface of sufficient size exists. Its precision exceeds that for routine oil immersion techniques but compares less favorably to that for minimum deviation methods. However, minimum deviation requires large crystals and, moreover, specifically oriented prisms, one for each principal refractive index to be measured and, for triclinic crystals, one for each wavelength of measurement. The phenomenon of polarized light reflection from randomly oriented anisotropic materials has been modeled because, only after a complete understanding of these phenomena could the RTR method be automated. The mathematics and physics required for this stem from theories and equations presented in the literature of ellipsometry, polarized light, and physical optics. These were then modified, rewritten, and unified to suit the requirements of RTR. RTR, first used by Wollaston (1802a, 1802b), was later perfected for the measurement of the refractive indices and orientation of biaxial minerals in thin section (Viola 1899a, 1899b, 1902; Cornu 1901, 1902). RTR with the Abbe-Pulfrich refractometer yielded refractive indices to a pre- cision of 0.0002, or better. Later, Smith (1905a, 1905b) introduced a simpler refractometer, now known as the jeweler's refractometer, which had a precision of 0.001 to +0.002. This refractometer is still in use by gemologists. During this century familiarity with the early work has declined; thus several recent papers display a lack of knowledge of aspects of RTR which were al- ready documented in the early 1900s. A new automated refractometer, designed by Bloss, has precision of +0.0002 and will be able to measure the refractive indices and orientation of a biaxial mineral in a petrographic thin section. Even for triclinic crystals, a single polished surface arbitrarily oriented will suffice for measurement of all three principal refractive indices, whatever the wavelength supplied. The design and testing of this refractometer has taken approximately three years. Two prototypes have been built and tested. Results from the second prototype are presented.""]"

Additional species were collected, but material was inadequate to describe them completely. Cultures of eight and synthesized ectomycorrhizae of six of the Suillus species are described. Synoptic keys to the basidiocarps and to the cultures are presented. Numerical taxonomic analyses of the cultures generated clusters which paralleled the species concepts developed using basidiocarps and ecology. Each species of Suillus from Nepal is host specific based on basidiocarp formation; all hosts are in the Pinaceae. Field associations are Suillus cf. granulatus, S. cf. placidus, S. sibiricus, and greening-foot Suillus with Pinus wallichiana; queen's Suillus with P. roxburghii; waxy Suillus with P. patula; and S. laricinus, himalayan Suillus, and orange-pored Suillus with Larix himalaica. Mycorrhizal syntheses confirmed that the six Suillus-Pinus relationships are ectomycorrhizal. The Suillus mycota of western Virginia has 12 known species. Three, of the five which are ectomycorrhizal with Pinus strobus, have closely related counterparts in Nepal. These counterparts are ectomycorrhizal with P. wallichiana, a five-needled pine closely related to P. strobus. The existence of these three pairs of similar fungi, associated with similar pines, suggests the possibility of cladogenic speciation in parallel by the pine lineage and by its ectomycorrhizal fungal associates. Boletinellus merulioides forms abundant sclerotia in nature throughout its range in eastern North America. Sclerotia collected in the forest germinated to form mycelial colonies that had the same appearance and microscopic characteristics as colonies derived from basidiocarps. Sclerotia which had overwintered in the forest were viable in the spring. The spatial pattern of B. merulioides sclerotia in a forest was compared with basidiocarp frequency recorded over four years. Both estimates of the spatial pattern coincided, but year-to-year basidiocarp frequency varied greatly. Individual B. merulioides dikaryons formed large perennial patches. Basidiocarp and sclerotial densities were centered around and declined outward from Fraxinus americana trees.

This dissertation will be a comprehensive test of Jensen and Meckling\'s agency theory including extensions by Rozeff, Easterbrook, Myers and Jensen. To test agency theory a contemporaneous three equation model determining managerial ownership, leverage and dividends is specified. The exogenous variables include variables which are expected to impact upon agency costs, diversification measures, and variables registering non-agency explanations of leverage and dividends. This dissertation provides critically needed empirical evidence on the agency problem and a specific test of Jensen and Meckling.']"

Marshall Committee Chairman: Dr. Kenneth Underwood Educational Administration (ABSTRACT) The purpose of this study was to examine the trends, characteristics and the superintendent's perceptions in school districts with black superintendents. To accom- plish this objective, seven hypothesis statements were used to examine nine variables related to financial and racial data in the selected districts. The population for this study consisted of 83 black superintendents, serving in school districts in 14 states. The participants were asked to provide biograph- - ical data and respond to a five-point rating scale that represented their perception on statements related to trends and characteristics in their districts. The demo- graphic data was collected from the United States Census Bureau and the Joint Center for Political Studies. The two-section instrument used in the study was developed by the researcher. The first section collected biographical data used to establish the superintendent's profile. The second part of the instrument consisted of 30 Likert type statements used to establish the superin- tendents' perceptions. The profile data on the superintendents was analyzed using the statistical package for Social Science (SPSS) frequency distribution and cross-tabulation procedures. The demographic data was analyzed using SPSS frequency distribution, means, cross-tabulation and standard devia- tion. The Runs Test (at .05 significance level ) was used to substantiate data randomness and to examine trends. The findings reveal definite trends and unique conditions in school districts with black superintendents.""]"

Riad, Chairman Electrical Engineering (ABSTRACT) This dissertation summarizes the research performed towards the development, analysis, and testing of two new sample configurations used for characterizing dielectric materials over a wide band of frequencies. In the two configurations, a cylindrical cavity completely filled with a sample of the dielectric material of interest is used. The two configurations are the following: 1. The cylindrical cavity is adapted to the end of a transmission line and the reflection coefficient is measured. The complex permittivity of the dielectric sample is then derived from the measured reflection coefficient information. 2. The cylindrical cavity is placed between two transmission lines. The complex permittivity of the dielectric material can be computed from either the measured re- flection coefficient or the measured transmission coefficient. The full field analysis of these configurations is carried out and the solution is ob- tained using the method of moments. Computer simulation experiments are performed to test the sensitivity of these techniques and predict their performance. Actual exper- iments on some dielectric materials with known dielectric properties are performed for verification. The first configuration is also used to characterize two thick film dielectric materials. These configurations proved to provide solutions to the many problems with the conventional configurations found in the literature.']"

Tang E. G. Henneke, II, Chairman Engineering Mechanics (ABSTRACT) Low frequency Lamb waves in composite laminates were investigated theoretically and experimentally. To have a general solution for Lamb wave propagation in multi- layered composite laminates is not practical due to a large number of boundary condi- tions needed to be satisfied at the interlaminar interfaces. Various approximate theories have been proposed to model low frequency Lamb wave propagation in composite laminates. In the present study, an approximate solution was derived from an elemen- tary shear deformation plate theory and was shown to work well in the low frequency, long wavelength region. A simple method, similar in configuration to the acousto-ultrasonic technique, was used to measure Lamb wave phase velocities. Low frequency Lamb waves, usually in the range of 10 kHz to 1 MHz, were generated. Dispersion curves of the lowest sym- metric Lamb mode and the lowest antisymmetric Lamb mode were obtained. The ex- perimental data were compared with the results obtained from the approximate solution for the lowest Lamb modes in the low frequency, long wavelength region for a unidirectional laminate, a symmetric cross-ply laminate, a symmetric quasi-isotropic laminate and an aluminum plate. There is good correlation between the data and the results obtained from the approximate solution, which suggests that the lowest Lamb modes are modeled adequately by the present theory in these cases. This experimental procedure of measuring phase velocities can be used to characterize laminated composite plates with and without damage since each material and stacking sequence gives distinct lowest symmetric and antisymmetric curves. Stiffness reduction of composite laminates caused by damage can be related to the change in Lamb wave propagation speed. Damage in the form of transverse cracks in the 90° plies of a [90/90/90/0], graphite/epoxy laminate reduced the phase velocities of the Lamb modes. The lowest antisymmetric mode is sensitive to stiffness reduction in composite plates. Consequently, axial stiffness reduction in [0/45/0/45/0/45], and [0]12 woven graphite/polyimide composite laminates was monitored by the lowest antisym- metric Lamb mode.']"

McKenna Dale D. Wolf, Chairman Agronomy (ABSTRACT) Cool-season perennial grass growth is suppressed during hot, dry summers. This ""summer slump"" reduces the availability of grazable forage. Tall-growing perennial warm-season grasses that produce 65 to 75% of their yield in midsummer may provide needed herbage during this period of reduced cool-season forage production. However, establishment of perennial warm-season species is slow and inconsistent when compared to cool-season species. Before these warm-season species can be relied on for summer forage production, a successful establishment methodology must be developed. A study was conducted to evaluate the influence of atrazine [2-chloro-4(ethylamino)-s-triazine and carbofuran on establishment of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Caucasian bluestem [Bothriochloa caucasica (Trin.) C. E. Hubbard]. Treatments of carbofuran at 0 and 1.1 kg atrazine/ha placed in the row with the seed and of atrazine broadcast at 0, 1.1, and 2.2 kg/ha were imposed in all possible combinations. Another study investi- gated the influence of limestone, P, and carbofuran on the establishment of switchgrass. Treatments included carbofuran at 0 and 1.1 kg/ha, limestone at o and 4.48 Mg/ha, and P at 0 and 22 kg/ha in all possible combinations. Seedling growth rate, leaf appearance rate, plant height, and leaf elongation rate (LER) of seedlings were recorded. Seedling weight and populations were determined at the sixth leaf stage of development. Yields of forage and botanical compositions were also measured in the establishment year. Establishment was further evaluated with yield measurements the year after seeding. Carbofuran application increased first year yield, seedling weight, population, leaf ap- pearance rate, and seedling growth rate. Atrazine reduced seedling population, weight, leaf appearance rate, LER, and yield. Carbofuran partially moderated atrazine influ- ence. The 2.2 kg rate of atrazine tended to injure the switchgrass more than the Caucasian bluestem. In the study investigating limestone and P, carbofuran increased yield, seedling weight, seedling population, LER, seedling growth rate, and leaf appear- ance rate. The greatest yield, leaf appearance rate, and LER occurred with applications of P and carbofuran. Even though initial soil pH was 5.1, limestone broadcast prior to planting did not influence seedling measurements and yields in either year. These plantings were made during 1985 and 1986, which were the driest summers in recent years. In spite of the moisture stress, acceptable stands of perennial warm-season grasses were established in both experiments in both years. Including 1.1 kg granular carbofuran/ha in the row, and broadcast application of 1.1 kg atrazine/ha at planting will improve establishment of perennial warm-season grasses. Where the P levels in the soil are low, a broadcast application of 22 kg P/ha improves chances for successful es- tablishment.']"

Grymes Committee Chair: Janet Sawyers Family and Child Development (ABSTRACT) The fields of family studies and child development share many similar concepts, yet the relationship between the two is rarely tested. This study is an exploratory examination of the conceptual similarities between the Circumplex Model of Family Functioning (Olson, Sprenkle, & Russell, 1979) and the Maccoby and Martin (1983) model of parenting typologies. Adaptability in the Olson model is conceptually similar to the demandingness/control dimension desribed by Maccoby and Martin, while cohesion is conceptually similar to the warmth-hostility dimension. It was hypothesized that each parenting type would exhibit specific family functioning styles. Participants were recruited through ten area day care centers. Thirty-five mothers and twenty- four fathers participated. Self-report and observational methods were used. Parents were administered FACES III and the PARI at group meetings at the respective centers. Seventeen families agreed to participate in an at-home session, where two observational game-tasks, the Guess the Rules game to measure adaptability and the Kvebaek Family Sculpture Task to measure cohesion, were completed. Analysis of variance, correlation coeffecients, and chi-square statistics were used to test the hypothesized relationships. Two anomolous findings occurred: almost half the parents described their families as chaotic and over half the parents were typed as uninvolved. These findings influenced the results. The results suggest some support for the conceptual similarities between the models. Correlations between the FACES and PARI subscales were low but significant, suggesting adaptability and authoritarian control, as well as cohesion and hostility-rejection are related. ANOVA results suggested that the parenting group means for the FACES subscale scores were significantly different, and in directions that support the model. Parents who described themselves as permissive perceived themselves as the most adaptable and parents who percieved themselves as uninvolved perceived their families as the least cohesive.""]"

Randall, Jr. Khidir W. Hilu, Chairman Botany (ABSTRACT) In mixed stands of the annual Impatiens capensis and 1. pallida, bumblebees visit 1. pallida almost exclusively even when the nutritional reward of I. pallida is removed. This phenomenon contradicts certain models proposed for foraging behavior in simultaneously flowering species and those dealing with optimal foraging. Such foraging behavior could have potentially devastating effects on the nonpreferred species, especially if the plant is an annual. Both Impatiens species share the same primary pollinators when they grow allopatrically, but when they grow sympatrically I. pallida continues to attract bumblebees while 1. capensis depends on hummingbirds and small bees for pollination. Thus competition for pollinators between these Impatiens represents an important plant-plant and plant-pollinator interaction with potential consequences. When 1. capensis is less frequented by bumblebees when sympatric with I. pallida, 1. capensis exhibits reduced fecundity. Mechanisms of interference through improper pollen transfer are described for the Impatiens species. Pollen of I. pallida adheres to and germinates on the stigmas of I. capensis and the pollen tubes reach the ovules. In contrast, pollen of I. capensis adheres poorly to I. pallida stigmas and fails to germinate. No hybridization occurs between the species. Scanning electron micrographs of pollen and stigma surfaces of the two species revealed no morphological differences. Among the floral characteristics examined, only flower color appeared to influence bumblebee preference for I. pallida. Differences between the species in ultraviolet absorbance patterns, perianth size and shape, odor, and nectar quantity and quality did not affect the pollinator preference of bumblebees. Differences in nectar characteristics and production rate were found among Impatiens populations. However, nectar quantity, quality, and production rates did not differ within allopatric or sympatric populations, but both species had higher nectar volumes with lower solute concentrations in the morning, and lower nectar volumes with higher solute concentrations in the late afternoon. Differences in nectar volumes among populations appeared to be associated with environmental factors affecting population sites. 1. capensis avoids competition and maintains itself in sympatric populations with I. pallida by depending on hummingbirds and insects other than bumblebees as pollinators, and has the ability to produce cleistogamous flowers and their subsequent progeny to ensure sexual reproduction. However, inbred progeny of I. capensis are competitively inferior to outcrossed stock. Nevertheless, I. capensis does persist in mixed stands of 1. pallida despite the absence of bumblebee pollination and the presence of lower seed set.']"

L. Reifsnider Engineering Science and Mechanics (ABSTRACT) Composite laminates are prone to delamination at free edges, straight edges or at holes, due to the mismatch at interfaces where two adjacent plies have different fiber orientations and/or different material properties. The linear analysis of the mismatch at the edge results in a mathematical singularity. That phenomenon occurs in a boundary layer and has to be treated mathematically and physically as such. In the literature it is called the ""Boundary Layer Effect"" or simply the ""Edge Effect"". It is of great importance to recognize and be able to predict delamination locations at edges prone to such events. The goal of this research was to create a model capable of providing such a prediction. In an effort to generalize the model, the more complicated case of a free edge at holes in the composite laminate was chosen rather then the case of a straight free edge. A sequel of three major efforts was completed: 1) Development of the analysis of the free-edge effect at a hole in a composite laminate, 2) Performance of an extensive experimental program to provide data for the creation of the prediction model, and 3) On the basis of the analysis, ii establishment of the model, and comparison with the experimental results. The prediction model consists of two major products of the analysis, the order of the singularity and the strain energy release rate. Both are useful in locating the interface most prone to delaminate and the point along the hole circumference where it initiates. Two material systems (AS4/3501-6 and AS4/1808) and two stacking sequences [ (0/45/0/-45) ) ] and [ (0/45/90/-45) ] , quasi-orthotropic s 4 s 4 and juasi-isotropic respectively, were quasi-statically tested under tension and compression. The specimens were X-rayed after each loading stage in order to locate the initiation of delaminations. The fact that both materials consisted of the same type of fibers, was an excellent opportunity to examine the performance of the matrix and its influence on the process of delamination. Matrix dependent behavior was successfully examined and studied through the experiments and the prediction model. Results showed good correlation and high sensitivity to the type of matrix material involved. iii']"

McKeen (ABSTRACT) Experts have suggested that a restructuring of the organization of schools is one way to improve the teaching profession. One way to bring about such a restructuring is to allow teachers the opportunity to build collegial relationships. Advocates of peer coaching believe that it can be used to bring about this opportunity to build collegial relationships and allow for the restructuring of schools in order to create a more professional working environment in which teachers work and learn together. This restructuring should decrease isolation of teachers by creating a working environment of trust and allowing for greater resources sharing among the teachers. In turn, teachers' levels of job satisfaction should increase which ultimately should result in better teaching. However, there is little, if any, empirical support for this claim. Administrators who are interested in restructuring schools need information about the implications of building such collegial relationships on the profession of teaching and the working environment of the school. In order to provide this information, 565 teachers in a large suburban Virginia public school system that had implemented peer coaching for a two-year period were surveyed. A questionnaire was used to document the teachers' levels of job satisfaction and perceived usefulness of peer coaching, as well as their perceptions about the degree to which trust and sharing of resources (interactions) existed in their schools. The data collected from the questionnaire was entered into a computer using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS*) Specifically, descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) and Pearson product-moment correlations were used to describe selected variables and explore interrelationships between the variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine to what extent differences existed between elementary, middle, and high school teachers on the selected variables in the study. Based on the results, the teachers agreed that peer coaching was useful and that they trusted each other. Their participation in resources sharing tended to be more infrequent than frequent. They were satisfied with their teaching jobs. Further, it was found that pairs of the variables were positively and moderately correlated except for a weak correlation between resources sharing and job satisfaction. This meant that, on the whole, the more useful teachers found peer coaching, the more satisfied they were with their jobs, along with perceiving greater degrees of trust and resources sharing. No differences were found to exist among the three levels of teachers on the usefulness of peer coaching or job satisfaction. All levels differed on the degree of trust that existed in their school. Middle school teachers differed from elementary on the frequency of resources sharing. In conclusion, peer coaching appears to have reduced isolation among the teachers and provided teachers the opportunity to learn about their teaching on the job. Further training in feedback skills and group process skills along with more opportunities to observe one another are recommended as ways to further reduce isolation and create conditions in which teachers are more able to collaboratively solve problems. An analysis of correlated curve trend experiments in Eucalyptus grandis by Brian Victor Bredenkamp Harold E. Burkhart, Chairman Forestry (ABSTRACT) Correlated curve trend (C.C.T.) experiments in Eucalyptus grandis on the Zululand coast of South Africa were analyzed. Growth parameters were described as functions of age using Schnute's gen- eralized growth function and parameter estimates were described as functions of stand density. Growth attributes were used as moments of a probability density function to describe a diameter distribution model for the species. Time trends in the relationships between growth parameters and stand density were scrutinized with multiple comparisons of paired means. It was shown that di- ameter growth in lower size classes ceases under conditions of extreme suppression while growth continues unabated in the larger size classes, resulting in greater dispersion in diameter. Competition mortality was to a large extent confined to the lower size classes and severe mortality results in an apparent increase in mean diameter which precludes use of growth functions which impose an asymptote. Allometric growth was investigated on two different sites and growth trends were shown to be anamorphic between sites. This permits a ratio approach to the estimation of growth and yield on one site based on experimental evidence from another. Thinning effects in terms of diameter and height changes were estimated from simulated thinnings using data from unthinned stands while the results of long-term thinning studies were compared in terms of cumulative volume yields. The age at which mean annual increment culminates was determined and a model for the estimation of m.a.i. as a function of age and stand density was constructed. A critical examination of spacing in- dices revealed that the slopes thereof were much steeper than those for many other species. The better-known indices of Reineke and Yoda were found to be dependent on age.""]"

Such questions have only begun to be raised in the field of counselor education. Hence, the education and supervision of counseling students has remained largely an amorphous undertaking. In this study the researcher sought to examine how Master's level counseling students differed on measures of behavior, personality and theoretical orientation. Behavior patterns were assessed using Hutchins' metatheoretical model, called the T-F-A system, and the Hutchins Behavior Inventory (H.B.I. ) that measures thinking, feeling and acting dimen- ii sions of human behavior. Personality characteristics were assessed using the Adjective Check List (A.C.L.) . Theoreti- cal orientations were assessed using a modified Smith Questionnaire. The students were divided into groups on the basis of behavior patterns, theoretical orientations, and gender. The issue of differences across these groups on measures of personality and behavior was then investigated. Results indicated that the H.B.I. works very well in assess- ing a) different personality orientations, b) responses to specific situations and c) theoretical preferences of counseling students. The existence of significant differen- ces across theoretical orientation, behavior pattern, and gender groups on measures of behavior and personality calls for the development of a prescriptive approach to the training of counseling students. Results clearly suggest how counselors need to adapt to the specific client situa- tions to maximize the possibility of behavior change. Implications for counselor education programs are discussed. iii""]"

Stalford, Chairman Aerospace and Ocean Engineering (ABSTRACT) The engagement between an antiship missile and a ship\'s defence system is in- vestigated. The missile is equipped with proportional navigation guidance for homing in on its ship target. The ship\'s defense system consists of a radar, an estimation system (the extended Kalman filter and the ""jump filter"" are used), and a gun system. The performance index is defined as the estimated number of hits (EHITS) of projectiles on the missile. The main objective of this dissertation is to determine maneuvering periods for the missile which minimize the EHITS to evade the ship\'s gunfire under different engagement conditions. The maneuvering periods are design parameters in the missile\'s controls of both the vertical and the hori- zontal planes. The engagement conditions are the follows : the maximum am- plitude of the maneuvering functions, the homing in position of the missile on the ship, the measurement noise condition of the ship\'s radar, and the missile\'s model assumed in the ship\'s filters. The missile\'s control functions considered are peri- odic and of specific types (sinusoidal, square and sawtooth waveforms); therefore, the periods which minimize the EHITS in this study are suboptimal for the gen- eral engagement problem. Two methods are used to obtain the suboptimal periods: one is the ""brute force"" method of computing the EHITS for certain equally spaced periods, the other uses an optimization software to search for the minimum point. The results show that the curve of EHITS VS. period is monotonically decreasing until it reaches a minimum point. The optimal period increases with an increase in measurement noise. Among the three waveforms used, the square wave gives the smallest op- timal period and the sawtooth wave gives the largest one. The sinusoidal waveform with the period of 1.9 seconds is recommended. We consider the mis- sile\'s performance against a perfect radar, a modern radar, and an earlier model radar. The optimum EHITS resulting from the optimal periods are between two and three EHITS for all three radars considered.']"

One can only wonder if German education has, as some critics like to put it, swept the Nazi period dis- - creetly under the carpet? This study has attempted to answer this question by analyzing 22 West German history textbooks currently used in all three of the traditional German high schools. This study is both quantitative and qualitative. First a check list was used to determine what percentage of each book is devoted to the Nazi period and in particu- lar to a set of basic themes considered important to any coverage of this period. Then, each book was analyzed to determine if there are any serious omissions, inaccuracies, biased or ambiguous statements about the Nazi period. When useful, a comparison of the treatment of the various themes under review was made. Considering the problems involved in writing history textbooks for such diverse audiences and school districts, this study finds that, in general, the West German secondary school history textbooks are presenting an accurate, if somewhat limited, account of the Nazi period. In conclusion, the findings of this study indicate that while an accurate portrayal of the Nazi period is presented in the textbooks surveyed, bias by omission does exist, especially when dealing with racial policies, the anti-Nazi resistance movement, and any question of respon- sibility. Certainly, improvements can be made in these specific areas.']"

Current studies are sparse, indicating that Mentor Programs may improve self-concept, but empirical assessments are lacking. This study investigated the efficacy of a mentor model on self-concept and achievement variables of intermediate school underachievers. A Mentor Program model was implemented with an experimental group of 55 underachieving students in a Fairfax County, Virginia, intermediate school. A 42 student control group of underachievers in another Fairfax County intermediate school were monitored. Forty education staff members served as mentors to the experimental group of students. The study was of a quasi-experimental, non- equivalent control group design. Primary measurement instruments used were the Self - Concept and Motivation Inventory (SCAMIN), an appropriate measure of self-concept in the school setting, the Grade Point Average (GPA), the standard measure of academic achievement, and the Failure Rate, including students retentions and classes failed. Four research questions were investigated. For testing overall effects of the treatment/Mentor Program at the school level, a Value Added Analysis was performed. For testing the hypotheses, the following analyses were undertaken: ANCOVAs were performed on the achievement data; t-tests and ANOVAs were performed on the self-concept data, Chi-square, t-test, and ANOVA were performed on the failure data. Canonical Correlation Analysis was performed to explain the relationship between the predictor measures and the criterion measures. Descriptive and ethnographic information in the form of quantitative and qualitative data analyses added to the breadth of the assessment. Results revealed that the Mentor Program produced positive, nonsignificant gains at the experimental school. The gains were better than those at the control school, but not significantly better. Analysis of the results also disclosed changes in the study design should be considered for future research. Recommendations include two year assessments, multiple school comparisons, and longitudinal studies. Post program results from teacher ratings, mentor and students evaluations were positive, providing qualitative statements of program worth. The findings and conclusions drawn from this study serve to further improve program evaluation and assessment of Mentor Programs.']"

The sample consisted of 400 licensed professional counselors selected randomly from a mailing list of the 1,038 licensees supplied by the Virginia Board of Professional Counselors. The response rate was 81.75%. While some LPC's remain in positions they have held for years, some are new at their jobs and some work part-time. Those surveyed include persons working in administration, counselor education, and other various occupations, as well as full-time practitioners. Survey instruments included the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire as a measure of general job satisfaction and 20 subscales, The Occupational Environment Scales measuring occupational stress and six subscales, and a data form. The data form was developed to collect demographical information. By combining the demographic data generated in this study, a description can be developed of LPC's in Virginia. Of 281 counselors identifying their work setting, 40.2% specified they were employed in education. Practitioner was the selection chosen by 49.1% of the respondents to disclose their present role. Ninety-three percent of the counselors were white and 55.8% were female. Experience was indicated as over 10 years for 74.4% of those responding and 54.7% of the sample have been licensed from 5 to 10 years. Of 294 responding counselors all but one had a masters or postmasters degree. Of the counselors participating, 48.5% indicated they experienced some job stress, but 78.5% indicated they were satisfied with their present job. Although a negative relationship was found between overall occupational stress and job satisfaction, stress resulting from work responsibility impacted positively with job satisfaction. As the score on the stress subscale responsibility increases, the score on general job satisfaction increases. Older, more experienced counselors indicated higher levels of job satisfaction.""]"

McGrath Department of Chemistry (ABSTRACT) The impact of multiphase polymeric materials has been enhanced by the preparation of well defined block and graft copolymers. Hence, there has been a growing emphasis on new synthetic methods for the preparation of blocks and grafts. Group Transfer Polymerization (GTP) is a relatively new synthetic method which provides a means to obtain poly (alkyl acrylate)s and poly (alkyl methacrylate) s via a ""living"" mechanism over a broad temperature range. The degree of control over molecular weight and molecular weight distribution rivals that afforded through living anionic techniques for the preparation of poly(alky1 methacrylate) s. The objectives of this research were many fold. The first was to establish GTP as a routine synthetic tool for the preparation of poly(alkyl methacrylate) s in our laboratories. This involved utilizing a variety of initiators, catalysts and alkyl methacrylate monomers. Furthermore, kinetic studies of the GTP of MMA with a controlled temperature, ""living"" polymerization reactor and tetrabutylammonium benzoate as the selected catalyst were initiated. These investigations involved the determination of the reaction order with respect to initiator and catalyst concentrations. Also, the global energy of activation, under controlled reaction conditions, was elucidated. To extend the synthetic utility of GTP, novel block and graft copolymers were synthesized. Transformation reactions and the macromonomer technique to interrelate different synthetic routes further extends the range of block and graft copolymers which can be prepared. Poly (dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) macromers were prepared via the anionic ring opening polymerization of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, which is subsequently terminated with a chlorosilane derivative of allyl methacrylate. The macromonomer technique has been employed to synthesize poly(methyl- nethacrylate)-g-poly(dimethylsiloxane) copolymers of controlled molecular weight and apparent narrow molecular weight distribution by GPC. Transformation of the methacrylate functional group on the PDMS provided a suitable macroinitiator for the GTP of methyl methacrylate, which leads to siloxane-b-methacrylate copolymers via a novel route.']"

Arnold James E. McGrath, Committee Chairperson Department of Chemistry (ABSTRACT) Fully imidized, high molecular weight polyimide homopolymers and random segmented poly(siloxane imide) and poly(aryl ether imide) copolymers were prepared for use as environmentally stable, tough structural matrix resins, structural adhesives, and dielectric materials. Although polyimides are well suited for such high performance engineering applications due to their excellent thermal and mechanical properties, their typical intractability in the fully imidized state has been a serious limitiation. Therefore, this research has specifically focused upon several methods by which the processability of polyimide systems may be improved. One method involved the utilization of a solution imidization technique in converting the poly(amic acid) intermediate to the fully cyclized polyimide. Another important method was the incorporation of a monofunctional reagents to obtain controlled endgroups and molecular weights. Structural modifications achieved by either copolymerization with polydimethylsiloxane or polyaryl ether sulfones or ketones, or variation of the dianhydrides or diamines resulted in major strides in obtaining enhanced processability, particularly when coupled with controlled molecular weight and the solution imidization technique. Significant reductions in the dielectric constant and water sorption, and improvements in processability were obtained by incorporating relatively nonpolar reactants, such as fluorinated dianhydrides, hydrophobic aromatic diamines, and polydimethylsiloxane oligomers. The poly(aryl ether imide) segmented copolymers displayed high glass transition values, excellent toughness, and remarkable solution processability. In some cases, a two phase morphology was obtained, dependent upon the polarity of the imide component. The thermal behavior of the poly(siloxane imide) segmented copolymers was dependent upon the siloxane oligomer molecular weight, the level of siloxane incorporation, and the nature of the imide component. Microphase separation was achieved at a relatively low molecular weight for a copolymer system based upon benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) and 3, 3'-diaminodiphenylsulfone (m-DDS). Decreasing the polarity of the imide component, however, resulted in a more phase mixed morphology, as determined by thermal analysis. The BTDA and m-DDS based copolymer systems, with a siloxane oligomer <Mn> of 950 g/mole, behaved essentially as modified polyimides at low siloxane levels. At higher siloxane concentrations, the copolymers were analogous to thermopolastic elastomers. The incorporation of polydimethylsiloxane imparted a number of additional benefits, including enhanced solubility, reduced water sorption, good thermal and ultraviolet stability, resistance to degradation in aggressive oxygen environments, flammability resistance, improved impact resistance, and modified surface properties. Another approach to capitalize on the benefits of siloxane incorporation was to utilize poly(siloxane imide) segmented copolymers as blend components with other high performance engineering polymers, such as polybenzimidazole (PBI) and poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK). Miscibility was obtained for most PBI and PEEK blend systems which were investigated. Blends of PEEK with polyimides based on BTDA and m-DDS were not miscible. Likewise, blends of PBI with polyimides based upon 6F dianhydride and m- or p-DDS were immiscible as well. Poly(siloxane imide) segmented copolymers and blends of these copolymers with PBI displayed excellent stability to high energy, high flux atomic oxygen, due to a conversion of the siloxane component to a stable silicate-like structure.""]"

SPIROCHETE, A LIVING NEWSPAPER, 1937-39, PRODUCED BY THE FEDERAL THEATRE PROJECT AN INSTRUMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION IN THE WAR ON SYPHILIS by Libra J. Cleveland Gysel Committee Chairman: Harold W. Stubblefield Adult Education (ABSTRACT) This historical case study examined the Federal Theatre's Living Newspaper Spirochete, a dramatized history of syphilis, and its relationship to public health education during the late 1930s. The materials for this historical case study were found in the Library of Congress Federal Theatre Project Special Collection, Fenwick Library, George Mason University, and in materials from the Records of the Works Projects Administration located in the National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D. C. The study sought to examine and establish Spirochete as an example of a special relationship among government, health, education and the arts. An investigation of Spirochete's relationship to public health education and an inquiry into Spirochete as a dramatic form provided the basis for the study. The study found that Spirochete's origins lay in the unique socio- economic and political environment of Chicago, and of the nation, during the mid to late 1930s. Spirochete was similar to other Living Newspapers in its goal to inform audiences about a pressing social problem, to present facts and information, and then to motivate action resulting in social change. Spirochete's form and techniques incorporated many of those found in other Federal Theatre Living Newspapers including many short scenes separated by Black Outs, experimental staging, and the innovative use of light, sound and spectacle to underscore and forward the dramatic action. Spirochete, however, was unique in its subject, syphilis, in its historical perspective, and its use of dramatized case histories juxtaposed with on-stage demonstrations of medical and scientific progress. The study determined that the more than 100 performances of Spirochete in five cities made significant contributions to health issues and attitudes in the War on Syphilis. Spirochete helped break the silence that surrounded the nation's number one preventable killer and crippler. Spirochete imparted facts about syphilis in dramatic vignettes and with creative, innovative stagecraft. Although Spirochete cannot be considered great theatre, according to the criteria of most theatre authorities, Spirochete was a vibrant, viable form of education. Spirochete was propaganda, presenting a definite idea for a definite purpose. Conclusions drawn from the study indicate that Spirochete was an intentional, unique, and vital weapon in the War on Syphilis.""]"

Arhancet Mark E. Davis Chemical Engineering (ABSTRACT) This work describes a novel family of catalysts denoted Supported Aqueous Phase Catalysts ( S.A.P.C. ). These catalysts consist of a water-soluble organometallic complex supported in a thin film of water residing on a high surface area hydrophilic solid; the reaction takes place at the water-organic interface where the organic contains the reactants and products. This novel type of catalysis is demonstrated by liquid phase hydroformylation. The support chosen is CPG-240, a porous glass with a narrow pore volume distribution. The catalytic species, HRh(CO)(m-P(PhSO3Na)3]3 was synthesized from Rh(CO)2(acac) by a new synthetic route and the complex was characterized by 31P solution NMR, 1H solid-state NMR, and FTIR. After dissolving the catalytic species in water, it was impregnated into CPG-240. The hydroformylation of oleyl alcohol (OLOH) was accomplished at 100°C and 725 psig of H2/CO = 1:1 using 0.002g Rh/g OLOH. As an example, after 5.5 h of contact time, 96.6% conversion was achieved. Evidence of no leaching of Rh was obtained by filtering away the supported catalyst and attempting both the hydroformylation of additional OLOH and the hydrogenation of added 1-hexene. The absence of conversion in both cases indicated that Rh was not leached into the organic phase. Because: (1) OLOH is not water soluble, (2) its double bond is internal and (3) the Rh does not leach into the organic phase, the concept of SAPC, which is to perform catalysis at an interface, is proven.']"

Wilkes, Chairman Chemical Engineering (ABSTRACT) Structure-property relationships were investigated for electron beam(EB) irradiated monomeric and polymeric systems. The objectives were to study the feasibility of preparing systems of potential application, and to characterize these systems in terms of structure-property behavior. In this thesis, the basic theories on radiation chemistry were first reviewed. Next, five different studies on the application of EB radiation were discussed. In the first study on the surface modification of the methacrylic acid derivative of the glycidyl ether of bis-phenol A(bis-GMA) substrates, considerable changes in wetting characteristics were observed using functionalized poly(dimethyl siloxane)(PDMS) oligomers as surface modifiers. Systematic studies were conducted to investigate the ef- fects of the type of functionality, the molecular weight of PDMS and the radiation dosage, etc. The second subject was on the structure-property behavior of EB cross- linked caprolactone-allyl glycidy1 ether(CL-AGE) copolymers. EB radiation was utilized to crosslink these materials at various temperatures both above and below the crystalline melting point. The final solid state properties were found to be strongly dependent on the morphological state of the CL-AGE copolymer at the time of EB irradiation. In the third study, models of time-temperature-energy(TTE) diagrams in an idealized EB radi- ation curing system were developed to help provide a conceptual understanding of the TTE relationship. Three general adiabatic cases were presented with increasing degree of complexity: the first considered only heating through EB energy dissipation, while the second and third attempted to include a kinetic exotherm, and the effects of glass tran- sition and vitrification behavior, respectively. The fourth study focused on the effects of EB irradiation on the mechanical and thermal properties of poly(phenylene sulfide). The effects of morphological state and atmospheric environment such as air or nitrogen during the irradiation process were investigated in terms of structure-property behavior. In the fifth study, two systems(symmetric and asymmetric) based on the controlled dis- tribution of bis-GMA within a crosslinked nitrile rubber(NBR) network were prepared utilizing EB irradiation. The prepared symmetric and asymmetric distributions of bis-GMA and the morphological structure of the NBR/bis-GMA system were investi- gated by dynamic mechanical as well as by FTIR and polarizing optical microscopy analyses.']"

The results of the measurements show that Hc increases with the increasing hydrophobicity of a solid and varies inversely with the work of adhesion (WA) of water on the solid. The relationship between Hc and WA has, therefore, been used to estimate the values of Hc for the systems in which direct measurement is not possible. Thermodynamic calculations have been carried out for the bubble- particle adhesion process using the DLVO theory modified to include interaction energies due to structural forces. The calculations required knowledge of the values of various parameters such as, Hc, zeta potentials and Hamaker constants for both bubbles and particles. The results of the calculations conducted on methylated silica and coal show that the thin film ruptures mainly due to the attractive structural force (i.e., hydrophobic interaction) For silica and mica immersed in dodecylamine hydrochloride solutions, the major driving force for film rupture is either the attractive electrostatic force or the hydrophobic interaction force, depending on the pH and the amine concentration.']"

Due to their geologic abundance, high surface area, and reactivity clay minerals are important participants in the diagenesis of clastic rocks. The kinetic and thermodynamic stability of clays is in general poorly understood. This dissertation research measured the rate of transformation of kaolinite to muscovite/illite and developed a method to estimate clay mineral thermodynamic stability. Clastic rock diagenesis is controlled by the rates of silicate mineral growth and transformation. Marine mudstones commonly contain large proportions of kaolinite which reacts during diagenesis to form muscovite/illite and/or chlorite. Batch reactor experiments were used to measure the reaction rate of 1.5 kaolinite + K+ = muscovite + H+ + 1.5 H2O using the initial rate method and a fitted form of the integrated rate equation. Experiments were performed at temperatures ranging from 250° to 307°C with solutions of 0.5 - 2.0 m KCI. These results can then be extrapolated to diagenetic temperatures using the Arrhenius equation. In addition, a technique was developed to estimate the AG° and AHF of silicate minerals. Silicate minerals have been shown to act as a combination of basic polyhedral units (Hazen 1985 and 1988). This work showed that their thermodynamic properties could be modeled as the sum of polyhedral contributions. A multiple linear regression model was used to find the contribution of the oxide and hydroxide components (gi and hi) to the AG, and of a selected group of aluminosilicate minerals at 298 K. The AG, and AH, of other silicate minerals can be estimated from a weighted sum of the contribution of each oxide and hydroxide component (gi and hi). These results can be also used to estimate the AG° of silicate minerals at higher temperatures (up to =600 K) by using the equation, gi (T)= hi (298) - T ( hi (298) - gi (298) 298']"

Miller, Jr. Biology (ABSTRACT) This work consists of an introduction, six chapters dealing with various aspects of the response of mycorrhizal fungi to copper, and a brief conclusion. The first chapter examines the enzyme tyrosinase in several ectomycorrhizal fungi and shows that its activity is altered in these fungi in response to copper. Polyamines are also examined in this chapter, and it is shown that their levels are altered in some ectomycorrhizal fungi due to copper stress but not in others. The second chapter uses transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate that copper is bound to the hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi grown on solid media, but the location of the binding varies between fungal species. In vitro copper tolerances of a number of ectomycorrhizal species are compared in this chapter and differences in tolerance are evident between species and between different isolates of the same species. In the third chapter, four ectomycorrhizal fungi and one nonmycorrhizal fungus are evaluated for their ability to improve the growth of Japanese Red Pine under conditions of copper stress. Improvement of pine seedling growth is not correlated with in vitro copper toler- ance of the fungus, but is related to the degree of compatibility between host and fungus. Despite differences in in vitro tolerance between three isolates of the same species, there are no differences in the effect of the isolates on the tree host under conditions of copper stress. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were also inoculated in pairs on pine seedlings and the competitive abilities of the fungi are com- pared under stressed and nonstressed conditions. The fourth chapter discusses the results of inoc- ulation of pine with a nonhost fungus which stimulates dichotomous branching of the root system. The compound responsible for the branching is demonstrated to be indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a plant growth hormone. The final two chapters deal with endomycorrhizal fungi. In the first of the two, inoculation of onion with an endomycorrhizal fungus demonstrates that the fungus probably plays no direct role in the response of the plant to heavy metals, based on biomass production, nutrient uptake, and photosynthetic rate. The last chapter demonstrates that the vascular plants found on abandoned mines in Virginia and North Carolina are well colonized by endomycorrhizal fungi; thus, an absence of these fungi is not a reason for the limited natural recolonization of the mine spoils.']"

To ensure that the relevance of adopting of innovative processing technologies was examined within an accurate contextual environment, additional important strategies and performance were also measured. A mail survey of the seventy-five largest North American producers of these two products provided the primary data necessary to investigate the strategic importance of process technology adoption, forward vertical integration, relative market share, grade sector focus, and investment intensity on firm performance as measured by profitability surrogates and changes in relative market share. This survey collected direct measures of the proportion of 1987 production produced by respondent firms that used controlled distribution channels and each of twenty-three processes indicative of innovative technologies in the manufacture of building products. Information concerning the other strategic and performance factors was collected from secondary data sources. Results indicate that the adoption of innovative processing technologies has a positive impact on firm profitability. Investment intensity and grade sector focus also contributed to superior profitability. Forward vertical integration, and relative market share had no impact in differences between performance levels for the firms studied. Technologies were examined for underlying dimensions that group different process technologies together. Firms were clustered according to their level of adoption of innovative processing technologies and these clusters were then described according to a variety of firm-dependent characteristics, strategies and performance measures.

Morris Committee Chairperson: Marcie Boucouvalas Adult Continuing Education (ABSTRACT) This qualitative case study addressed the question, ""What strategies and tactics do people use to access intuition in solving complex, ill-structured problems?"" Such problems are not routine, well-defined, or solved by immediate application of well-known procedures or decision rules. A comprehensive literature review revealed a paucity of empirical data on accessing intuition during problem solving. Additionally, while some posited a relationship between ill-structured problems and intuitions, no studies existed linking the two. This study explored people\'s specific actions at the moment when an overall solution becomes apparent to the problem solver. It focused on both the conscious actions people take to access their intuition (strategies) and on the conscious or unconscious skills, clusters of related skills, or procedures (tactics) they use (Gerber, 1983), as well as underlying tacit processes (Fischbein, 1987). Participants were 11 human resource managers. This group was chosen because its members frequently encounter complex, ill-structured problems or help others focus on how to solve such problems. Specific individuals were recommended by colleagues who considered them to be articulate and interested in intuition. They completed journals to document the moment of solution and participated in follow- up, in-depth interviews. To ensure internal validity, participants acted in the role of ""co-researchers."" They reviewed manuscripts, journals, and interviews for accuracy and reviewed written narratives to ensure that their statements had been understood. Two corraborated the process of category construction. A qualitative content analysis of journal results indicated that in seven instances intuitions occurred when participants were with others and that these seven were listening in some fashion at the moment of solution. Further analysis, which incorporated the interviews, indicated that actions most frequently taken at the moment of intuition included immersion, searching, thinking-working on task, undirected thinking, making connections, and listening. Whether a given action was a strategy, tactic, or tacit process depended on how deliberately people acted and how aware they were of their actions. Results also showed that problems were ill-structured and that intuitions had characteristics consistent with those identified by Fischbein (1987). Finally, the study found that, for the participants in this case study, the dynamics of intuition can be summed up with the following proposition: A propelling concern to solve a complex problem leads to continuous search and spontaneous combustion. Implications for future research suggest the need for a conceptual framework for studying intuition; extended research in the workplace and other settings, examining especially instances when people are with others at the moment of solution; a more in-depth investigation of actions to access intuition, focusing on specific actions such as listening as well as the sequencing of all actions; and inquiry into how people\'s values and beliefs affect their actions. It is recommended that practitioners join in research efforts as well as engage learners in an exploration of their own actions to access intuition during problem solving.']"

To examine the views of secondary school principals involved in the study, twenty scenarios were developed which portrayed situations that principals typically encounter. School divisions in Virginia were divided into four categories according to enrollment and the number of secondary schools in the division. Ten schools from each classification were randomly selected, and on-site interviews were conducted with each principal in which four of the scenarios and a survey form were employed to collect information. Responses of the principals to the scenarios were transcribed, analyzed and distilled. The scenarios and responses became the foundation for the development of a primer on ethics for use in administrative in-service workshops and principal preparation programs. The primer was used in designing and presenting in- service programs on ethics for the administrative staffs of two school divisions. Responses by principals to situations presented during the study and the in-service programs indicate that practicing and potential school administrators would benefit by having ethics included as a fundamental part of their professional preparation program.']"

A general expression for the intensity distribution emerging from a multimode liber is formulated, covering both few mode and highly multimode fibers, and new expressions for their sonsitivity to both radial and axial strain are derived. Optimized mullimode fibers are seen to show am intringic phase bengitivity which rivals or even surpasses that of the single mode interferometer, especially in the case of applied radial strain. The use of modal domain sensors for real-time ultrasonic wave transduction is described as y particular application to NDE, with experimental results being presented with regard to accustie emission monitoring 38 well as the detection and analysis of shock waves due to inmpact. Finally, optimization schemes and alternatives for such sensors are addressed, and recommendations for future work are raised.']"

Rogers Family and Child Development (ABSTRACT) Playfulness, externality, self-perceptions, IQ, first-grade readiness, and selected demographic variables were studied in a sample of 93 first and second grade children. Playfulness and externality were obtained from teacher ratings on the Child Behaviors Inventory and self-perceptions were obtained via child interviews using Harter and Pike's (1984) Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children. Neither playfulness nor externality correlated significantly with any of the following self-perception scales: (a) cognitive competence, (b) peer acceptance, (c) physical competence, and (d) maternal acceptance. Pearson correlation coefficients reflected a significant ii iii but low relationship between IQ (measured via the Block Design and Vocabulary subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised) (r = .26, p < .05) and Playfulness. A significant but low correlation was also found between Playfulness and social status (r = . .26, p < . 05) . A principal components factor analysis, followed by varimax rotation yielded a four factor solution. Factor 1 was comprised of cognitive variables (IQ and first-grade readiness) . Factor 2 was comprised of the self-perception subscales. Factor 3 was Externality and Factor 4 loaded heavily for gender. Examination of the final communality estimate indicated that playfulness contributed little to the total variance and should be interpreted as a measure of a trait which is independent of cognitive functioning, self-perceptions, externality, gender and age.""]"

More specifically, it proposes the steps in unveiling the relationships between chosen core elements of cultural distinctness and various design patterns. The suggested sources of core elements are political, social/behavioral, and economic influences on architectural design and approaches to create architectural signs. It is presupposed that a design pattern is considered culturally identifiable when important core elements are communicated via noticeable signs. The communication is perceived from a semiotic analogy of architectural signs, whereby the importance of one core element over the other is identified by the investigator through research into the cultural context under study. A case study on China's architecture is presented to illustrate these steps and test the proposed hypotheses. The steps are so designed that testing the relevance of core elements to architectural signs is essential. Forty-six sample buildings se- lected from China served as stimulus materials in the case study. These building patterns were rated as different types of signs on the basis of the core elements elicited from China's present-day culture. These buildings also were judged in a survey by forty-four Chinese students and their spouses at Virginia Polytechnic Insti- tute and State University who represent samples of overseas Chinese laypersons. TOWARDS A CULTURALLY IDENTIFIABLE ARCHITECTURE The findings show that survey results deviated significantly from the semiotic results as laypersons considered traditional architecture most representative of Chinese identity. The semiotic results show that culturally identifiable designs are the hybrid forms of traditional and modern architecture. Most laypersons ignored the relationships between their perception of distinct identity in architecture and core elements of economic meanings and sign-creation approaches. This deviation im- plies a significant cultural lag in perceiving distinct identity between professionals and laypersons, and led to modification of the presupposed hierarchical importance of core elements. Through the case study and findings, this research illustrates the procedure by which investigators can determine from a specific range of cultural elements the most effective means of communication of identity. It enables the inclusion of core ele- ments of popular culture in comparing various design patterns and in differentiating built forms of one culture from that of others. The study ends with the factors and suggestions that are related to communication of Chinese identity in architecture. TOWARDS A CULTURALLY IDENTIFIABLE ARCHITECTURE""]"

A. Dillard Engineering Science and Mechanics (ABSTRACT) Transient moisture conditions can accelerate the viscoelastic behavior of certain materials over that of constant moisture conditions. This is termed the mechano-sorptive phenomenon. The thrust of this research effort is to study the mechano-sorptive effects on the creep behavior of synthetic fibers and composite materials. This study consisted of two main parts: 1). a phenomenological investigation of the transient moisture effects in synthetic fibers and composite materials and 2). mechanistic studies of the observed phenomenon. The materials studied included Kevlar® fibers, Kevlar® fiber reinforced composites, Technora fibers, poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) fibers, and Nylon 6,6 fibers. Unidirectional ( 0° ) Kevlar® 49/7714 epoxy coupons undergoing desorption exhibited an increase in tensile and bending creep deformations, a decrease in storage modulus, and an increase in the loss tangent (Tan 8) when compared to coupons maintained at a constant (saturated) moisture content. However, the transient moisture effects were not seen in composite coupons along the matrix direction. Experimental results showed that aramid fibers exhibited logarithmic creep behavior under tensile load. Even though different constant moisture conditions did not have appreciable effects on the creep behavior of aramid fibers, the creep process increased substantially under transient moisture conditions. The logarithmic creep rates and the mechano-sorptive effects increased with temperature. The creep activation energies of Kevlaro fibers are: 4.84 Kcal/mole for the cyclic moisture conditions and 1.04 Kcal/mole for the constant (saturated) moisture condition. Increases in stress may increase the logarithmic creep rates but may reduce the mechano-sorptive effect. In addition, the creep behavior under transient moisture conditions was nonlinearly dependent on stress. The fiber elastic compliance was observed to increase after creep deformation. Moreover, it was found that the fiber elastic compliance has correlation with the logarithmic creep rates. Aramid fibers contain hydrogen bonds between rod-like crystallites oriented at small angles relative to the fiber axis. These F /drogen bonds may be disrupted during a transient moisture process. The breakage of thene hydrogen bonds may cause slippage of hydrogen bonded crystallites and result in accelerated crystallite rotations, thus causing increases in logarithmic creep rate. Aralysis indicated that the obtained activation energy (4.84 Kcal/mole) and the reduction in fiber elastic compliance due to creep deformation support the proposed mechanisms.']"

A three-fold approach included: first, use of field test sites to select an herbicide sensitive to environmental conditions; second, quantify herbicide responses to temperature, moisture, and morphological conditions; and third, conduct laboratory research to determine if differential uptake, translocation, or metabolism would account for these responses to the environment. Section one of the research was designed to determine if field research can be used to detect herbicides sensitive to environmental influences. Herbicides compared were: imazaquin, BAS 514 and tridiphane to fenoxaprop-ethyl (the cool-season herbicide standard) for postemergence control of large crabgrass (Digitaria sanquinalis) in Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) and bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) turf. BAS 514 was significantly influenced by variable environment. Section two of the research studied control of southern crabgrass (Digitaria ciliaris) by BAS 514 as influenced by morphological and physiological factors. BAS 514 efficacy was influenced by crabgrass growth stage, air temperature, and irrigation level. Flowering crabgrass plants were the most tolerant, while preemergence and true-leaf stages were the most sensitive. Plants held at soil moisture levels near saturation and 25° C were the most sensitive to BAS 514. BAS 514 was not effective against plants grown at low moisture levels and 15° or 35° C. Section three of the research compared the uptake, distribution, and metabolism of 14c BAS 514 in southern crabgrass and Kentucky bluegrass plants, a sensitive and non- sensitive species. Foliar applied BAS 514 was rapidly absorbed by both species. Uptake and partitioning was similar in both species from 0.5 to 32 h, but different at 128 h, with bluegrass more uniformly distributing the herbicide. Metabolism of BAS 514 was low with only 3% metabolism in both species. Uptake, distribution, and metabolism apparently are not involved in differential sensitivity to BAS 514. Field research can be used to select an herbicide sensitive to environmental influences. Temperature and soil moisture influenced the herbicidal activity of BAS 514. Uptake, translocation and metabolism did not appear to influence selectivity of this herbicide.']"

Barton John G. Dillard, Committee Chairman Department of Chemistry (ABSTRACT) The growth of Fe3O4 and FeOOH crystals was investigated. Growth modifiers were used to alter the formation of iron oxides from ferrous hydroxide precipitates. Multifunctional carboxylic acids were found to have a strong influence on morphology of FeOOH. Dicarboxylic acids, containing two and seven carbons, changed the characteristics of a-FeOOH. These changes included alteration of the isoelectic point of the particulates and changes in particle size and shape. EDTA was found to alter the phase of FeOOH formation, favoring the synthesis of ~-FeOOH over a-FeOOH at temperatures below 50°C. The effects of multifunctional carboxic acids were dependent upon the time of addition, and the presence of other growth modifiers. The changes in FeOOH formation were postulated to occur due to interaction between the acid molecules and Green Rust II, a common intermediate in iron oxide growth. The growth of Fe3O4 was found to be sensitive to solution pH, and the form of the iron starting materials. Examination of reaction intermediates by x-ray diffraction showed that other crystalline phases formed prior to the production of Fe3O4. Different intermediate phases occurred depending on the amount of hydroxide in the reaction, and differences in Fe³+ starting materials. The production of different intermediate phases affected the morphology of Fe3O4 Early precipitation of Fe3O4 led to small particles, while formation of crystalline Fe(OH)2 led to large crystals. Formation of a mixture of Green Rust Il and Fe(OH)2 early in the oxidation process led to formation of multiple nuclei, and produced smaller average particles with a wide particle size distribution. Fe3O4 particles prepared from a-FeOOH seed crystals were spherical, while Fe3O4 particles prepared from FeSO4 alone were octahedral crystals.']"

This method is used to study the nonlinear behavior of combustion driven oscillations in cylindrical combustion chambers in which the liquid propellants are injected uniformiy across the injector face and the combustion process is distributed throughout the combustion chamber. Crocco\'s time-lag (n, T) hypothesis is used to describe the unsteady combustion process, and the hot combustion products are assumed to leave the combustion chamber through a quasi-steady nozzle. In a second order analysis the steady state Mach number is assumed to be small and the conservation equations are combined to obtain a single nonlinear partial differential equation which describes the behavior of the velocity potential. The velocity potential is expanded in a series of acoustic modes, each of which is multiplied by an unknown time-dependent coefficient. Using this series and applying the Galerkin orthogonality criteria yields a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically. Numerical calculations are used to predict the following phenomena: (1) the final amplitude attained in an unstable engine, (2) ""triggering"" of instability by finite amplitude disturbances in a linearly stable engine, and (3) the shape of the nonlinear pressure waves. The dependence of the resulting oscillation upon the engine parameters is Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. XV also determined. Restrictions imposed on the second order theory include small Mach number mean flow, irrotational flow, and the presence of waves of moderate amplitude. In order to relax some of these restrictions a third order theory is developed. The resulting conservation equations can no longer be reduced to a single equation governing the behavior of the velocity potential; instead a system of partial differential equations must be solved. Because of the complexity of these equations, the behavior of a single transverse mode is studied by approximating each of the dependent variables as the product of an amplitude function and the spatial dependence of that mode. The resulting solutions are then compared with those obtained from the second order analysis. On the basis of results obtained from the second and third order theories the following nonlinear mechanisms were found to be important in determining the nonlinear stability characteristies of the system (1) the transfer of energy between modes, (2) the self-coupling of a mode with itself, and (3) a nonlinear combustion mass source. The self- coupling mechanism was found to be very important in the initiation of triggered instability, while the nonlinear driving mechanism was important in the determination of the final amplitude of triggered instability.

Some electrophysiological experiments reveal the importance of excitatory and inhibitory transients. Moreover, visual masking experiments suggest that similar transient responses are active in temporal phenomena of human vision. To determine the role played by transient inhibition in masking and metacontrast, increment thresholds for 5 msec. foveal test flashes on an adapting field were obtained at various times before and after the onset of a 500 msec. masking annulus. Since the effectiveness of a brief test flash is a measure of the magnitude of the inhibitory transient at various points in its time course, the visual masking functions constructed from the threshold data represented an indirect picture of the temporal course of lateral inhibition. The results clearly demonstrated that increasing the retinal illuminance of the masking annulus increased the magnitude and decreased the latency of the peaks of the masking functions. As the retinal illumi- nance of the masking flash was increased by three log units, the peak masking effect for three observers shifted from test flashes presented 50 msec. after the mask onset to flashes presented simultaneously with the mask. The masking functions were interpreted in terms of a transient inhibition theory, and the results were compared with other visual masking theories. viii.

Chairman: Harvey E. Brazer The appropriate role of government in financing personal health care expenditures is a controversial subject in poli- tical life and in welfare economics. In my thesis I examine the welfare economic aspects of financing medical care. I argue that there is no one appropriate role for government independent of the values of citizens. The traditional welfare economics approach creates a strong case for laissez-faire. This case rests on the assump- tions that: (1) the technological externalities generated by personal health care are minor and (2) redistribution in kind is inefficient. I argue that the latter assumption is not necessarily valid. The alleged inefficiency of in kind redistribution is based on the notion that the potential beneficiary could do at least as well and usually better if he were given the cash equivalent. The preferences or values of the potential tax- payer are ignored. My thesis builds upon the work of Tibor Scitovsky and James Buchanan who have explicitly challenged the second assumption and upon the work of Mark Pauly and C. M. Lindsay who in their work on efficiency in financing medical care, have implicitly challenged it. These men have incorporated tax- payer preferences into their analysis, but in doing so they have left out beneficiary preferences. I develop a general model within which any possible combination of taxpayer and beneficiary preferences can be analyzed. I show that the traditional case against redistribution in kind as well as the work of Scitovsky, Buchanan, Pauly and Lindsay are very special cases based upon particular assumptions about pre- ferences of potential taxpayers and beneficiaries and on implicit or explicit interpersonal utility comparisons. The reader may then judge for himself how accurate are the former and how appealing are the latter. The latter are not unimpor- tant; in fact, I show that values about the distribution of income are the most important ones in determining the appro- priate role of government. In addition to establishing that subsidizing personal health care expenditures may be efficient, I examine the most efficient methods of subsidizing medical care in order to achieve alternative policy goals. I show that a vanishing tax credit for health services would be a more efficient method of assuring that all individuals consumed at least some minimum amount of care than eeither a tax credit for health insurance er a free health service. Under certain circum- stances, however, the latter might be a more efficient method of achieving equal access to health care.']"

Doctor of Business Administration, 1970 Dissertation directed by William B. widhelm, Ph.D. Assistant Professor of Business Administration University of Maryland This dissertation develops a structured Markovian analysis of the quality characteristics of a large class of systems. Being Markovian, the proposed models require the use of state variables to describe the quality levels at various points 1n the system and transition matrices to describe the error-producing and error-detecting character- istics of the servers and machines that compose the system. Under these conditions, the models can predict the error+ level distributions of the various systems. Among the applications of this analysis are the design of systems for specified quality objectives, the selection of the optimal means of producing the same output when there are several means available, and the establishment of quality oriteria that can be used to evaluate system performance. The models can also be used to predict the effects on the error-level distribution due to changes in the quality of the incoming products, the performance characteristics of the operators or machines, and the quality reviewers. Ultimately, the model may be used to optimize the system's design by indicating the optimal number, type, and location of quality reviewers. In a sense, this dissertation can be considered an application of the principles of reliability engineering to systems design because it enables the analyst to measure the effects on the system's performance as the parameters are ranged. The basic model 1s applied to linear, branohing, loop, and merging systems so that the analyst can model each portion of a complex system separately and then combine the results to describe the entire system.

This phenomenon is studied further here, in particular in grid-generated, nearly isotropic turbulence and on the axis of a round jet. The ""small eddies"" concentrate in ran- dom domains occupying only a fairly small fraction of the fluid volume. Appropriately filtered hot-wire anemometer signals appear intermittent as the turbulent patterns are convected past the hot- wire by the mean flow. Measurements show the decrease in fine- structure volume as Reynolds number increases or as the size of the eddies studied decreases. The average linear dimension of these fine-structure regions turns out to be large compared with the sizes of the eddies with which they are active. This relative dimension decreases with increasing Reynolds number or with de- creasing eddy size. To study more about the statistical geometry of the fine- structure regions, two-probe coincidence functions for the occur- rence of fine-structure were measured as functions of the relative positions of the two probes. Three possible categories of geometry were considered: (a) ""blobs, n (b) ""rods,\' n (c) ""slabs, "" depending on whether the three mean orthogonal dimensions of the domains (a) are all of the same order, (b) show one an order larger than the other two, (c) show one an order smaller than the other two. ii Highly idealized paradigis for these three categories were computed analytically. The coincidence functions were computed for the cases of (a) spheres or (b) circular cylinders or (c) plane slabs, each ficld having random sizes distributed randomly in space with a homogeneous and isotropic statistical distribu- tion. Comparison of the actual turbulence data with these three paradigms suggests that the fine-structure regions are more likely to have random ""rod-like"" geometry than either of the other two. The flatness factors and probability distributions of the first derivative, the second derivative, and band-pass signals of the velocity fluctuations were also measured in grid-generated turbulence and on the axes of round jets. The turbulence Reynolds numbers Rx ranged from 12 to 830. The flatness factors of the velocity derivatives are sensitive to the high cut-off frequency of the electronic circuits. With high cut-off frequency set at Kolmogorov-scale frequency, the flatness factors of the first deriv- 0.2 0.62 ative vary with Rx for Rx < 200, vi th Rx for Rx> 500, and with a transition between these two ranges. Those of the second Rx 0.25 derivative vary with for Rx < 100 and with Rx 0.75 for Rx> 300. No sign of approaching asymptotic values was observed at Rx up to order of one thousand; this is contrary to the conjec- ture of absolute constant values at high Reynolds number made by Batchelor and Townsend. 1,9 The probability distributions of velocity fluctuations and large-scale signals are nearly normal, while the small-scale signals iii are not. The deviation from normality increases as we examine smaller and smaller scales extracted from the complete signal by proper filtering. The flatness factor of the filtered band-pass signal of the velocity fluctuation increases with incroasing fro- quency, while that of Gaussian noise is approximately 3.0 irre- spective of the frequency. The flatness factor of a band-pass sig- nal is dominated by the filter\'s smoothing (or averaging) effect if the filter bandwidth is very narrow. In the limit of infinitely narrow bandwidth, the application of the central limit theorem sug- gests that the band-pass signal is normal. The square of the signal associated with large wave numbers may be approximated by a log-normal probability distribution except for very small and very large amplitude ranges. iv c']"

The tielinks are used to connect the shear panels to the frame so that cracking can be included at the panel boundaries. The nonlinear material properties require the plane stress elements to have induced anisotropy under a general biaxial stress field. The method used here includes anisotropy for describing cracked elements, but assumes the uncracked elements to be isotropic. Material constitutive relations are not modified for the biaxial stress state. This method of analysis is applied to a set of test examples and to frame-and-panel models. Predictions of cracking, stress patterns, and deformations are compared to experimental re- sults where possible. A.C.

The presence of simple one-dimensional equipartition magnetic and cosmic-ray components is introduced explicitly in the gas hydrostatic equilibrium equation. The gas distribution Pg (z) is calculated for two limiting cases: (i) the total mass density at the galactic plane is equal to the sum of the observed gas and star densities in the solar neighborhood (0.089 My/pc3), and (ii) the Z component of the galactic gravitational acceleration K2 is supplied by Oort, in which case we implicitly assume that the total mass density at the galactic plane equals 0.15 M of pc 3 . Using recently observed values for the magnetic and cosmic-ray pressures, the Z component of the turbulent gas velocity in the solar neighborhood is established. A theoretical expression is derived for the half-thickness of the equilibrium disk of galactic gas. The half-thickness is found to be directly proportional to Q, where Q2 equals the square of the 2 Z component of the turbulent gas velocity plus the magnetic pressure divided by the gas density plus the cosmic-ray pressure divided by the gas density, and inversely proportional to the square root of the total mass density at the galactic plane. Using the Innanen galactic ii mass model, the half-thickness is computed as a function of distance from the galactic center and compared to the observations of McGee and Milton. The observed increase in half-thickness at distances beyond the solar distance Ro is reproduced theoretically. Finally, a galactic mass model is derived, using the observed half-width of the gas layer and an appropriate value for the Z component of the turbulent gas velocity independent of R. Comparison of the two mass models in the region 4 kpc R Ro indicates that Q may systematic- ally increase with decreasing R. A time-independent, linear, plane- and axially-symmetric per- turbation analysis is performed on a plane-parallel layer of non- magnetic, non-rotating gas. The gas layer is itself immersed in a plane-stratified isothermal slab of stars which supply a self-con- sistent gravitational field. Only the gaseous component is pertur- bed. Expressions are derived for the perturbed gas potential and perturbed gas density that satisfy both the Poisson and hydrostatic equilibrium equations. The equation governing the size of the per- turbations is found to be analogous to the one-dimensional time- independent Schrodinger equation for a particle bound by a potential well, and with similar boundary conditions. The perturbation radius is computed as a function of the parameter Q and compared with the Jeans' and Ledoux radii. Isodensity contours of the marginally unstable state are constructed. Large flattened objects with masses in the range 106 107 - Mo and radii in the symmetry plane character- iii istically 1-2 kpc result. Both the size and flattening increase as the star density at the galactic plane increases. Finally, the stability of a self-gravitating isothermal gas disk threaded by a one-dimensional equipartition magnetic field is considered with respect to waves with motions in the 3° - g plane and perpendicular to it. In the latter case, the magnetic field modifies the minimum length necessary to produce gravitational insta- bility by the factor , where C is the isothermal sound speed and a is the Alfvén velocity.""]"

Rate of convergence is bound for several specific algorithms. In particular a multipoint secant method is developed which uses no derivatives and yet converges to the root of systems of equations with the same rate as the Newton-Raphson method. Also rate of convergence is found for several conjugate gradient algorithms when they are used to minimize nonlinear, nonquadratic functions on Rn. Root finding algorithms can be classified by the amount of information or data used at each step. If one assumes infinite precision, it is possible to encode past information (memory) into a data point. We have added a condition to the definition of rate which insures that encoding does not improve the rate. Using this new definition, the class of optimal algorithms is obtained. The rate of convergence of the multipoint secant method is found with the help of an interpolatory error formula that is developed. The formula compares a function mapping Rn into Rn with an affine interpolation which agrees with the function at n + 1 points. V Rate of convergence of the conjugate gradient algorithms is found by comparing them with the Neweon-Raphson method. It is shown that n steps of these algorithms approach the minimum with rate two. This result is also shown to hold for the case where the conjugate variable is reinitialized every r steps (where r is greater or equal n). vi']"

By control structures is meant programming environments or operations which specify the sequencing and interpretation rules for programs or parts of programs. This dissertation attempts to demonstrate the thesis: complexity diminishes and clarity increases to a marked degree if algorithms are described in a language in which appropriate control structures are primitive or easily expressible. A number of control structures extant in programming languages and systems are catalogued and then used as a guide to develop a programming language which has a control extension facility. This language has not only the mechanical necessities for control extensions, but also has primitive control operations for sequential processing, parallel processing, alternative selection, monitoring, synchronization, and relative continuity. These operations are the source of the clarity of control descriptions because they span our conceptual notion of control and because they can be easily composed to form other more specialized control structures. ii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. The thesis is demonstrated by using the control description language to give formal descriptions of itself, the simulation language Sol, and a variety of specific control structures. Some nonstandard control structures (including a nondeterministic control called sidetracking, the continuously evaluating expression, and a multiple sequential control) are invented to further illustrate thé thesis. It is also shown that the use of nonstandard controls ins oome cases leads naturally to efficient implementations. The most extensive example given, uses the sidetrack control for parsing context-free languages. Beginning with a simple breadth first search recognition process, it is refined by the incorporation of appropriate control structures. Minor additions are then made to permit parsing, translation, and error correction. It is also shown that hybrid recognizers which merge several well known syntax analysis techniques can be easily built and an implementation of the sidetrack control which achieves the time bounds of Earley's parsing algorithm is also given. This investigation has only scratched the surface, but it is hoped that it has contributed to the understanding of control, illustrated the simplicity and clarity that can result from a conscious examination of control, and demonstrated the large, but unrealized, potential for variability in control: iii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The study was concerned with the analysis of the mechanical behavior of an idealized clay particle system. The mechanical behavior, the relationship between forces and deformations of the system, is postulated to be governed by repulsive and attractive forces among the particles. The repulsive forces in the clay-water system are primarily caused by the interaction of the diffuse double layers on the surfaces of the particles. Although other types of inter- actions occur at closer ranges, interparticle spacings in natural soils and man-made soil deposits which have engineering importance are rela- tively large (Lee, 1968). Repulsive forces can therefore be adequately expressed in terms of double layer theory. The attractive forces between clay particles have been attributed to van der Waals's forces; these forces only become important when particle spacing is very small. The objective of the analysis is to determine the repulsive forces among the particles, under various distortions of the model unit, in order to describe the volume change-force relationship for the model unit structure. Comparing the resulting volume change-force relation- ships to those obtained from experimental results confirms the value of the analysis. The forces in the double layer can be found from a force-field potential, and the distribution of potential is given by the funda- mental equation of the double layer, the Poisson-Boltzman equation. The nature of this equation is such that, with the exception of a few specialized cases, closed form solutions cannot be obtained. Numerical VIII methods must be resorted to. The results of the computations are pressure distributions on the planes of symmetry of the model unit, on the basis of which, repulsive forces may be determined. For an experimental verification of the analytical results, one- dimensional consolidation tests were conducted on Sodium-Montmorillonite. Montmorillonite was selected because of its high specific surface characteristics which magnify the interparticle force effects. Considering the method as a general technique for studying volume change characteristics of clayey soils; its limitations and applications to soils problems are discussed. IX""]"

The question of annexing the Hawaiian Islands sparked the first national debate in American history on overseas expansion. It continued for a period of five years. Finally, on July 6, 1898, in the midst of the Spanish- American War, the Senate passed a joint resolution annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States. This political action inaugurated an expansionist foreign policy that would reap an empire in less than a year. Historians have long debated the reasons that the United States suddenly cast aside its anti-colonial tra- dition. Indeed, the anti-colonial tradition seemed strengthened by the Congressional resolution for war with Spain in April, 1898. Paradoxically, in less than three Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Studies of late nineteenth century American expansion generally have concluded that the political decision for this departure in foreign policy reflected a favorable ex- pansionist sentiment within the nation. Some studies have described it as mass sentiment while other studies have referred to it as a growing sentiment during the 1890's without, however, defining the extent of change. These interpretations imply that by some method the politicians had received a measurement of this popular sentiment for expansion and that it had influenced some of their votes on the annexation issue. However, these interpretations generally fail to reveal the complicated nature of popular opinion. That is, they do not say what part of the American public held opinion on expansion, or indicate how popular opinion on expansion was communicated to the politicians, or point out to what extent popular expansionist opinion influenced the politician's vote on Hawaiian annexation. Present-day measuring devices of public opinion were not used in the 1890's. Hence there is no precise record of expansionist opinion on the question of annexing Hawaii. In an attempt to determine the role of public sentiment in the political decision for annexation, the student must arbitrarily select and analyze data which he feels will shed some light on the question. Modern theories about public opinion also are applied to the situation in the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The findings of this study indicate that popular opinion was possibly more disposed to accept Hawaiian annexation in 1898 than it had been in 1893. But the evidence also reveals that if a measurable change in public sentiment did occur during the 1890's, it occurred in small, sharply defined segments of the population called the foreign policy public. But being numerically small and divided along party lines the foreign policy public was ineffective in influencing political decisions on foreign policy. Indeed, expansionist sentiment may have had some influence on the final action for annexing Hawaii, but it was not the most important cause. The evidence indicates that there was no great upsurge of popular opinion for annexing Hawaii, but that the major political parties took opposite sides on the issue and that action, aided by the Spanish-American War, followed party alignment.

122,,"ortiz-garcia, angel luis",d.a.,history,andrew johnson's veto of the first reconstruction act,carnegie mellon university,1970,"['Angel Luls Ortlz-tarcla \'Andrew Johnson\'s veto of the first reconstruction act"" Carnegie-Mellor University ANDREW JOHNSON\'S VETO OF THE FIRST RECONSTRUCTION ACT ABSTRACT The purpose of this study is to analyze and clarify Andrew Johnson\'s reasons for the veto of the First Reconstruction Act. Previous historical explanations of this veto have been superficial and inadequate, usually limited to Johnson\'s attitude toward Congressional Reconstruction. The months of February and March, 1867, encompassed some of the most important moments in American history. In early March, Congress sent President Johnson the First Reconstruction Act, which provided a procedure for restoring the ex-Confederate states to the Union. Johnson\'s differences with Congress were well known, for he had previously vetoed the Freedmen\'s Bureau Bill on February 19, 1866, and the Civil Rights Act on March 27, 1866. The nation therefore expected that he also would veto the First Reconstruction Act. But a new Congress, dominated by Radicals, and many leaders of the Republican Party put pressure on Johnson to approve the legislation. Andrew Johnson was not a man to be intimidated by a difficult situation. He vetoed the bill on March 2, 1867. American historians have differed in their evaluation of Andrew Johnson and his role during Reconstruction. However, in spite of such differences, they can be classified roughly into three groups: earlier historians, the Dunning school, and revisionists of the Dunning achool. Earlier historians, -- those writing mainly before 1900--had in common the principal aim of justifying a sectional point of view. They also analyzed the period and evaluated Johnson superficially. Of these the most prominent were James F. Rhodes and Ellis P. Oberholtzer. Rhodes believed that Johnson\'s unreasoning obstinacy and stubbornness motivated his vetoes. Oberholtzer, on the other hand, created the stereotype of Johnson as a demagogue who hated gentlemen. Between 1898 and 1904, a new interpretation of the Reconstruction Period took shape. William A. Dunning, professor at the University of Columbia, provoked this interpretation through his books and lectures. Dunning, his students and followers, along with his colleague John W. Burgess, presented a picture of the evil and corruption manifested in Northern Republicans\' reconstruction policies in the South. They emphasized the harm done to the South by such policies. This school was also distinguished by its professionalism. It represented part of the first generation of academic historians in the United States, who went to original sources, interpreted them and reached conclusions. As one consequence, their interpretation enjoyed great prestige. The interpretation of the Dunning school passed almost unchallenged until the 1930\'s, when the so-called revisionists appeared. The revisionists started looking at the issues from a variety of other points of view. Consequently they pointed out the weaknesses of both Johnson and the Radicals. They began to retell the story of Reconstruction in terms of the economic and social forces at work in the nation without the preconceptions that limited the earlier groups. W.E.B. Du Bois, John Hope Franklin, Harvey Wish, David Donald, c. Vann Woodward, Hodding Carter and James G. Randall are some of these revisionist historians. However, except for quoting or referring to Johnson\'s veto message, none of these historians contributes any additional analysis of reasons for the veto. Moreover, scholars like David DeWitt, Robert Winston, and Eric L. McKitrick showed their confusion about this topic by stating mistakenly that Andrew Johnson might have defeated the First Reconstruction Act with a pocket veto. The findings of this etudy show that previous historical explanations of Johnson\'s veto of the First Reconstruction Act, which stressed that Johnson was stubborn, anti-Negro, conservative, and a believer in a states\' rights doctrine, have nuch validity. Yet these explanations need to be examined in detail to see how they apply to the veto of the First Reconstruction Act. In addition, Johnson had other reasons for his veto, among which were that the Act conflicted with his belief that order prevailed in the South, violated his desire for economic retrenchment, conflicted with his distrust for army men, and disrupted his pardon policies. Moreover, he was politically motivated, expecting that the veto would win him conservative support. This study discusses all of these factors which entered into Johnson\'s decision to veto the Act.']"

Its purpose is to illustrate the relationship between the representation chosen for a design problem and the methods developed for solving that problem. A formal class of ""floor plan""-type design problems is defined. In these problems 8. set of rectangular rooms is specified, and an allowable list of dimensions is given for each room. In addition, a set of required adjacencies between rooms, or between a room and an outside wall of the building, is given. The problem is to produce a rectangular floor plan of a building that contains all of the specified rooms, and that satisfies all of the adjacency end dimension requirements. A linear graph representation for floor plans is developed. This graph is the dual graph of the floor plan, itself treated as a linear graph. Thus, the nodes of the dual graph correspond to rooms, and the edges correspond to adjacencies between roous. The edges are colored and directed to indicate the different types of adjacencies (north, south, east, or west), and weights are assigned to edges to indicate the length of floor plan wall segments. Riles of well-formedness are developed for the colored, directed graph. Methods for producing solutions to the ""floor plan"" design problems are developed, based on the dual graph representation. These methods produce incomplete dual grephe as partial design solutions. 1 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. As an aid to handling these graphs, a planar graph grammar is intro- duced that allows one to keep track of the planarity of a graph, and to generate geometric realizations of any planar graph. The design methods are implemented in a computer program, GRAMPA, written in IPL-V. Several illustrative problems solved by GRAMPA are discussed. It is concluded that, with proper modifications, GRAMPA could be used either as a research tool or as a practical design program. 11 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

We showed that if such a force exists it should modify the logarithmic decrement of a heated, slowly oscillating cylinder in HeII. We measured the decrement of three cylinders as a function of power, as a function of period of oscillation, and as a function of temperature. After a correction, due to a small change in the ordinary viscous damping with heat applied, we compared our data to calculated values of the zero-power decrement and calculated values of the changes in the decrement upon heating. We found that the data agreed very well with our calculations. Since the theoretical calculations involve no adjustable parameters, we could conclude that heat can serve as a probe of the relative velocity of a solid body and the superfluid component of HeII.

Accordingly, the young had a low political, moral, and social status. They were not considered to be fit for leadership or worthy of respect and consideration. Keeping company with the young was not suitable for a political leader and might even by dangerous. Some authors tried to show that this popular conception of youth was not necessarily a valid one, but they were few. Moralists saw in youth the least desirable stage of life because it was conducive to the commission of sins.

The results, summar- ized for each type of embryo, are as follows. 1.) pipiens-pipiens- In this normal embryo, prior to gastrulation, all cells show an increasing tendency to attach to glass substrata in vitro with advancing develop- mental age, Dissociated presumptive mesodermal cells from early gastrulae show a high ability to attach to glass and to reaggregate. The rates:óf disaggregation of whole embryos show marked decreases with advancing age from the blastula to late gastrula period. Binary combinations of explanted embryonic germ layer fragments from early gastrulae undergo movements that are in part reminiscent of portions of gastrulation. At the level of fine structure, presumptive ectodermal cells form cell contacts which become increasingly intimate, as judged by closer apposi- tion of plasma membranes and overlapping filopodia, from the blastula to the late gastrula period. Presumptive mesodermal cells in early gastrulae have numerous close cell contacts and some tight junctions. 2.) pipiens-palustris- This viable hybrid embryo, which occasionally shows slight abnormality in invagination, is quite similar to pipiens- pipiens in all respects. Slight alterations in cell contact behavior correlate positively with slight abnormalities in gastrulation. 3.) pipiens-sylvatica- This hybrid undergoes a moderately severe develop- mental arrest at the onset of gastrulation. During a short time, when controls are undergoing epiboly, a severe wrinkling appears in the roof of the blastocoel. No extensive invagination or archenteron form- ation occurs. Animal cells show an increase in frequency of attachment while vegetal cells show none. Rates of disaggregation decrease moder- ately with advancing age. Explanted fragments show movements similar to those seen in normal fragment combinations. Presumptive mesodermal cells have a low frequency of attachment, moderately reduced ability to reaggregate, moderately increased separation between plasma membranes, and no tight junctions. 4.) pipiens-catesbeiana- This embryo undergoes a severe developmental arrest at the onset of gastrulation. Little or no increase in frequency of attachment occurs in any cells. All stages disaggregate rapidly. Explanted fragments show no movements. Presump- tive mesodermal cells have a low frequency of attachment, very little ability to reaggregate, moderately increased separation between plasma membranes, and no tight junctions. At the level of fine structure, pre- sumptive ectodermal cells do not form increasingly intimate contacts. 5.) pipiens-clamitans- This hybrid undergoes the most severe arrest at the onset of gastrulation. No increase in frequency of attachment occurs in any cells. Disaggregation rates remain high at all stages. Explanted fragments show no movements. Presumptive mesodermal cells have a low frequency of attachment, no ability to reaggregate, grossly increased separation between plasma membranes, and no tight junctions. These results indicate that extent of increase in cell surface adhesiveness and extent of normal gastrulation correlate positively. This suggests that increased cell surface adhesiveness is necessary for the morpho- genetic movements of gastrulation. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

L-Asparaginase resistant murine tumor cells produced 1.0- 1.6 nmoles L-asparagine/mg of cells/hour while sensitive tumor cells produced less than 0.1 nmole /mg of cells/ hour. The newly synthesized L-aspartic acid was largely localized in the cells; the newly synthesized L-asparagine, however, distributed both in the cells and in the medium. The L-asparagine analogs DONV (0.5 mM) and CONV (0.05 mM) inhibited L-asparagine production 86% and 95% respectively; no concurrent inhibition of L-aspartic acid production was observed. The purification (305-fold) and characterization of L- asparagine synthetase from one of the L-asparaginase resis- tant tumors, 6C3HED-RG1, is described. Initial velocity studies and product inhibition studies suggest that L- glutamine interacted with free L-asparagine synthetase and released L-glutamic acid, the aminated enzyme then reacted with ATP to release pyrophosphate and form an aminated and adenylated enzyme. The resultant modified enzyme then appears to react with L-aspartic acid to release AMP and L- asparagine. The proposed mechanism was supported by alter- nate substrate studies and reversibility studies. Dead-end inhibition studies with L-asparagine analogs indicated that DONV competed with the L-glutamine or L-asparagine site on the free enzyme, and that CONV interacted with two or more stable enzyme forms. L-Asparagine synthetase catalyzed a reaction with three substrates and four products, a Ter-Quad system according to Cleland's notation. Mathematical approaches have been used -to analyze the possible kinetic patterns and mechanisms in Cleland's graphical model. Several general equations were derived to express the overall number of patterns and mechan- isms at any number of substrates and products; and to express the specific number of patterns and mechanisms at any number of substrates, products and stable enzyme forms. The number of different mechanisms at S substrates, P products and n stable enzyme forms is given by s-1 d P -1 d n-1 n - -1 d d where d is summed over the common divisors of s, P and n; and is Euler's totient function.

The cities are: Milford and Bridgeport, Connecticut; and Chicopee and Springfield, Massachusetts. The model is based on ninety-four intensive interviews with various budgetary participants and citizens in the four cities. The interviews were conducted during June to November, 1968. After summarizing prior approaches to municipal budgeting and describing the four cities, a four stage budgetary process is developed. This process, made up of the formulation, review, decision, and expenditure stages, was used to structure and organize the research. Ninety-four interviews were held with a variety of budgetary participants and citizens in the four cities. Participant behavior was then analyzed for each of the four stages of the budgetary process. These results are summarized and form the basis for the model development. The last chapter summarizes the major findings and compares them to other research results in the budgetary field. Significant differences are found. The most important of these centers on the role of political and informal behavior manifested during the budgetary research. Extensive political and informal behavior was found in all four cities. Budgetary participants described instances of informal interaction during each stage of the budgetary process. The possible explanations for this behavior are then offered. After two process models depicting informal interaction and change are presented, four recommendations are made pertaining to the direction of future research efforts in the budgetary field.

Rochow, Advisor Summary Organosilicon chemistry has been refined until it has become possible to generalize somewhat and predict the behavior of the silicon-oxygen or silicon-nitrogen bond under different circum- stances. Such thorough study has not characterized organogerman- ium chemistry. Particularly within the much neglected area of organogermanium-nitrogen chemistry, too f wew compounds have been prepared to permit ell-founded generalization about bonding. In this research, a number of new organogermanium-nitroge compounds were characterized, primarily for purposes of comparison with related silazanes and silylamines. A consistent goal was to prepare compounds with low moisture sensitivity. Character- ization of N-pheny1 and N-cyclohexy1 organogermazanes by NMR, IR, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis added to what little had been known, particularly spectroscopically, about organo- germanium-nitrogen compounds. One noted some differences in the reactions of dimethyldichlorosilane and dimethyldichlorogerman with aromatic amines like aniline. The germazane products were monomers or six- and eight-membered heterocycles, rather than linear polymers. New linear silylamine and cross-linked germylamine polymers were prepared by reaction of dimethyldichlorosilane and dimethy1- dichlorogermane with the three isomeric xylylenediamines, The NMR spectra of these materials furnished readily interpretable compounds. The N,N'-bis-(trimethylsily1) and N,N'-bis-(trimethy1- contrasts yith the spectra of the previously known ethylenediamine germy1) derivatives of 0-, m-, and p-xylylenediamine were also characterized fully. The bis-(trimethylsily1) derivative of 2,3-dihydrophthalazine- 1,4-dione has been tentatively shown to involve Si-N rather than Si-o bonding. NMR spectra suggested that at room temperature rotation of the trimethy1sily1 groups is hindered in this compound. Low molecular weight polymers formed from 2,3-dihydrophthalazine- ,4-dione and limethyldichlorosilane or dimethyldichlorogermane have been characterized. Kummer and E.G. Rochow, Inorg.

An extensive review of literature of vertical-shaft spillways is presented. The horizontal conduit is designed to flow partly full at all discharges, since the transition from partly-full to full-pipe flow (seal- ing) is accompanied by vibrations of the structure and surging of the flow. The major effort of this investigation was to determine experi- mentally the flow conditions associated with incipient sealing in the horizontal leg of the spillway. The experimental study was done in a 4 in.-by-4 in. square conduit with three different circular bends, with various deflectors, and with various concentrations of air admitted with the water falling down the vertical shaft. Sealing depends on the Froude number of the flow in the horizontal conduit. To maintain partly-full flow, more space is needed above the water-flow area with an increase of Froude number. With short-tube control, the ratio of the radius of curvature along the centerline to the bend diameter, I/Df , and the deflector thickness at the crown of the bend determine the water-flow area in the horizontal conduit. Ventilation of the conduit delays sealing while aeration of the water flow hastens sealing. With weir control, waves on the flow surface hastens sealing and highly aerated flow delay sealing.

The majority of work concerned the oxidation of aromatic compounds with ground state atomic oxygen, o(³P). The experimental technique of choice was the mercury photosensitized decomposition of nitrous oxide at 2537A; a flow system at atmospheric pressure and 30°C was found to be convenient for most aromatic com- pounds studied. The compounds successfully oxidized were: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, tert-butylbenzene, ortho; meta-and para-xylene, mesitylene, 1, 2,3-trimethylbenzene, anisole, fluorobenzene, benzotri- fluoride and nitrobenzene. In every case the main products were phenols. When ortho-methyl groups were present, methyl cleavage (resulting in phenols) became an important reaction. No evidence for formation of anisoles was found in the most favorable case, that of 1, 2, 3-trimethylbenzene. - After the identity of the primary volatile addition products had been established, kinetic analysis of the relative reactivity (and attend- ant partial rate factors) was made. The logarithm of the partial rate factors gave a satisfactory Hammett relationship when plotted versus ot constants; this confirms the electrophilic nature of oxygen atoms. x It was also found that the logarithm of the partial rate factors gave a fair straight line when plotted against the calculated ground state electron densities of the aromatic hydrocarbons. This was interpreted as good evidence for an early rate-determining transition state in the o(3p) oxidation of hydrocarbons. The activating effect of methyl groups was found to be a function of their position and number. A plot of calcu- lated reactivity (based upon toluene) versus the experimental reactivity of the polymethylbenzenes as ordinate gives a straight line with a fall- off factor (slope) of o. 84. Linear free energy correlations with related reactions were also found. A kinetic isotope effect H of 1. 14) was determined for an equimolar mixture of benzene and deuterobenzene. This is in agree- ment with the mechanism of o(3p) oxidation of benzene shown below: H +01\'P) slow fast fast H -H° +H- O . OH O. ""-complex Since the partial rate factors for o(3) correlate well with calculated electron densities of the ground state hydrocarbon, the re- action is believed to have an early transition state. The absence of anisoles argues for two fast steps following T-complex formation rather than an intramolecular hydrogen shift. However, a one-step rearrange ment from the ""-complex to the product phenol is not ruled out. Oxidation of aromatics via a microwave glow discharge through CO2, O2 or N2O gave substantially different product distributions than did the mercury-nitrous oxide technique. Although benzene and benzo- trifluoride gave only phenols, toluene and para-xylene gave large amounts of side chain oxidation as well as substantial amounts of methyl cleavage. Thus the side chain in toluene was oxidized to give benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol as well as cleaved to produce phenol. Attempts to determine the side-chain oxidant in the discharge were made; excited aromatic substrate, ozone, o(1D) and o(3p) were considered. The best rationale at this time is that 013p), reacting at a high temper- - ature, is responsible for the observed products. The action of ozone on toluene and cyclohexane received brief attention as did the reaction of o(1D) with cyclohexane. The photode- compositions of various substrates as toluene, nitrobenzene, anisole, chlorobenzene and bromobenzene are also discussed. The possibility of nitrobenzene photolysis as a source of o(³P) was investigated; pre- liminary results imply that 013p) is not the sole oxidizing agent gener- - ated.']"

This method is used to study the nonlinear behavior of combustion driven oscillations in cylindrical combustion chambers in which the liquid propellants are injected uniformiy across the injector face and the combustion process is distributed throughout the combustion chamber. Crocco\'s time-lag (n, T) hypothesis is used to describe the unsteady combustion process, and the hot combustion products are assumed to leave the combustion chamber through a quasi-steady nozzle. In a second order analysis the steady state Mach number is assumed to be small and the conservation equations are combined to obtain a single nonlinear partial differential equation which describes the behavior of the velocity potential. The velocity potential is expanded in a series of acoustic modes, each of which is multiplied by an unknown time-dependent coefficient. Using this series and applying the Galerkin orthogonality criteria yields a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically. Numerical calculations are used to predict the following phenomena: (1) the final amplitude attained in an unstable engine, (2) ""triggering"" of instability by finite amplitude disturbances in a linearly stable engine, and (3) the shape of the nonlinear pressure waves. The dependence of the resulting oscillation upon the engine parameters is Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. XV also determined. Restrictions imposed on the second order theory include small Mach number mean flow, irrotational flow, and the presence of waves of moderate amplitude. In order to relax some of these restrictions a third order theory is developed. The resulting conservation equations can no longer be reduced to a single equation governing the behavior of the velocity potential; instead a system of partial differential equations must be solved. Because of the complexity of these equations, the behavior of a single transverse mode is studied by approximating each of the dependent variables as the product of an amplitude function and the spatial dependence of that mode. The resulting solutions are then compared with those obtained from the second order analysis. On the basis of results obtained from the second and third order theories the following nonlinear mechanisms were found to be important in determining the nonlinear stability characteristies of the system (1) the transfer of energy between modes, (2) the self-coupling of a mode with itself, and (3) a nonlinear combustion mass source. The self- coupling mechanism was found to be very important in the initiation of triggered instability, while the nonlinear driving mechanism was important in the determination of the final amplitude of triggered instability.

In many cases, to realize these advantages, the optical heterodyning must be done efficiently. This places some rather stringent requirements on the alignment of the optical system and the coherence of the signal and local oscillator fields. This research is a study of the effects of partial coherence of the signal and local oscillator fields on the performance of an optical heterodyne receiver; the theterodyne receiver efficiency and signal-to- noise ratio are taken as performance indicators. An analytical approach is taken where the heterodyne receiver efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio are defined mathematically for a general heterodyne system. Each is, then, related to the signal and local oscillator field coherence in a single expression. These expressions are applied to three specific heterodyne systems (1) a communications link through a turbulent atmosphere, (2) a laser heterodyne rough surface velocity measuring system, and (3) a laser heterodyne fluid flow velocity measuring system. In each system, the signal field coherence function is derived based on a statistical description of the system, and the heterodyne efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio are calculated and studied as functions of the receiver variables such as receiver aperture size and shape, local Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

From this study, the conclusions made are that for the heterodyne systems studied, efficient operation and good signal-to-noise ratios cannot be obtained simultaneously; the most important parameters are the size of the local oscillator intensity distribution and the size of the receiver aperture. The shape of the local oscillator intensity distribution and the shape of the receiver aperture have little effect on system performance, nor do slight reductions in local oscillator coherence. The performance of the surface velocity and fluid flow velocity measuring systems was studied experimentally. The experimentally measured efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio were compared to that predicted theoretically and found to be in close agreement. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

These substrate components may interact because the enzyme systems capable of catabolizing each substrate com- pete for supplying precursors for biomass synthesis. The substrate capable of supplying the anabolic pathways with needed precursors at the fastest rate is the primary substrate and is preferably catabolized. In some systems the enzymes of the secondary substrates are so regulated that the uptake of these substrates can be initiated only after a period of preferential utilization of the primary substrate. This research was undertaken to identify some of the environmental, physiological, and biochemical factors responsible for bringing about substrate inter- actions. The study was designed to provide information pertaining to the kinetics of growth and assimilation of competing substrates. The investigations were performed in a chemostat type reactor maintained at approximately 20°C The influents contained glucose and galactose as the competing substrates along with other non-limiting nutrients. Three sets of experimental runs were carried out using ga- lactose, glucose, and galactose-glucose mixtures, the latter in concerr tration ratios of 1.05 to 1.23:1.

The steady state data for all substrate systems showed that at high detention times (above 1.7 hours for glucose and 2.9 hours for galactose) slow growing microorganisms, characterized by a lower maxi- mum specific growth rate, kT, and a lower saturation constant, K, pre- vailed over the fast growers. At lower detention times the slow growers were selected against and microorganisms with a higher 1 and K became dominant. Steady state concentrations could be described by the Monod expression for specific growth rate. Glucose was found to be far more efficient than galactose in terms of the growth yield and specific growth rate attained at any sub- strate concentration. These two substrates were simultaneously assimi- lated from influents containing mixtures of the two. Glucose consumption, which remained unaffected in the presence of galactose, accounted for the growth yield, while assimilated galactose accounted for the energy of maintenance of all cells. With a mixed substrate, glucose controlled the growth rate, as this substrate sustains a higher cell yield and a faster rate of reproduction. Glucose stimulated the utilization of galactose as a supplementary energy source even though the galactose uptake rate per unit biomass was reduced considerably through non- competitive and feedback-type inhibition or the rate controlling galac- tose permease. Theoretical analysis indicated that in batch or plug flow reac- tors the slow growers would sequentially assimilate glucose and galac- tose at growth rates below 0.6/hour. However, the fast growers pre- ferred concurrent utilization if the ratio of initial galactose and Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Sequential utilization was not evidenced in the continuous flow system as the slow growers were replaced by organisms capable of concurrent assimilation. Thus, the mode and kinetics of assimilation (sequential or concurrent) of compet- ing substrates are determined by the nature of the specific growth rate functions with reference to the individual substrate concentrations, the relative configurations of the resultant specific growth rate curves of the various substrates, the ratio of concentrations of the substrates, and the type of flow model used for the culture system.

The purpose of this inves- - tigation was to provide insight into how the long-term pork system dynamics are dependent on the information feedback structures which control the system's important flows and accumulations. This know- ledge is needed to understand better the fundamental relationships and interactions among production, storage, processing, distribution, consumption, and pricing activities within the pork market. Cyclical patterns with an average duration of 48 months and amplitude variations of from + 25% to + 60% characterize the long term behavior of the pork system. Large variations in hog supplies and prices create problems such as resource allocation for the pro- ducer, plant utilization for the meat packer, product availability for the retailer, and proper pricing of pork products for the consumer. The study examined the way in which important pork system variables change and interact, and thereby create the cyclical pat- terns. An industrial dynamics model was developed and used to dem- onstrate which control loops and coupling loops were critical to the pork system's performance.

Variations in the receipt of pork sup- plies were amplified by the meat packers through their delayed re- sponses to a new input rate of pork supplies and their inventory con- trol policy. Amplification in the producers' operations occurred be- canse of the variable feeding delay and an over-responsive production policy. Relative to the purpose and objectives of the investigation, the feedback model was determined to be representative of the actual pork system structure. Drawing upon the model analysis, several specific conclusions were evident and recommendations for further study were suggested. The pork system gave rise to its own unstable behavior and the closed loops involving the meat packers and hog pro- ducers were found to be the primary determinants of the behavior. The model was used to demonstrate that in the pork system consumer responses, retailer inventory control and ordering, and producer capacity adjustments have little influence on the cyclical patterns. However, the cycle's period is sensitive to the coupling delay which connects hog prices to the producers' production response. Similarly the period is sensitive to the producers' hog inventory adjustment time. Amplitude characteristics of the model's behavior are sensi- tive to the meat packers' price adjustment parameter, and the pro- ducers' hog inventory adjustment parameter.

150,,"joy, edward bennett",ph.d.,electrical engineering,spatial sampling and filtering in near-field measurements,georgia institute of technology,1970,"['x SUMMARY It is well-known that the far-field of an arbitrary antenna may be calculated from near-field measurements. This approach to far-field determination is not new, but two important questions remain unanswered: 1. How far apart should the near-field sample points be spaced? 2. How can the amount of near-field data be reduced? To answer these questions, certain well-established communication techniques, centered around Fourier transform theory, are applied to the near-field - measurement problem in this work. Another well-known technique used in this investigation is the expansion of an arbitrary electromagnetic field as a continuum of plane waves. If an electromagnetic field is specified over a planar surface, its amplitude is related to its plane wave wavenumber spectrum through a Fourier transform. Additionally, on a sphere of infinite radius (i.e., the far field) , the same electromagnetic field is directly related to its wavenumber spectrum, but only for wavenumbers whose magnitude is less than 211/1. Using a scattering matrix approach, D. M. Kerns, Scientific Con- sultant to the Radio Standards Engineering Division of the National Bureau of Standards, has carefully analyzed the two antenna measurement system, and has concluded that the true wavenumber spectrum of the electromagnetic field may be found from the measured planar field if the complete Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. xi electromagnetic characterization of the measuring probe is known. Then, if the electromagnetic field is measured on a plane located a finite distance from an antenna, Fourier transform techniques may be used to analyze the far-field calculation problem. Plane waves, with wavenumbers greater than 21T/A, are attenuated with increasing wavenumber and with distance from the measurement plane. Once some arbitrary attenuation level and a distance from the antenna are selected, the sampling theorem from Fourier analysis can be used to choose the required sample spacing in the near field, sufficiently small to include all wavenumbers above the selected attenuation level. The sample spacing approaches an upper bound of X/2 at infinite separation from the antenna. Additional wavenumber limiting may be artificially effected through the use of low-pass spatial filtering of the measured near-field data. As the wavenumber limit of the low-pass filter decreases, the required post-filter sample spacing increases which, in effect, reduces the number of samples. The resulting wavenumber-limited data is found to contain all information necessary to calculate the far-field pattern of the antenna in well-defined angular sectors centered about the polar axis (the axis which is perpendicular to the measurement plane and passes through the origin of the selected system of coordinates). The angular size of these sectors is found to depend on the wavenumber limits of the low-pass filter. The far field over other sectors of interest can be found by applying wavenumber shifting (similar to the communication theory technique of frequency shifting) of the near-field data followed by the same low-pass filtering process. The number of post-filter samples Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. xii I needed to calculate a given sector of the far field can be predicted, and is shown to decrease monotonically with decreasing size of the sector. Even greater data minimization is possible for one-dimensional slices of the far-field pattern. This technique has been verified experimentally as follows: First, the complex on-axis polarization ratio of a far-field probe antenna was determined through a new measurement technique from a set of three on-axis polarization ratio measurements made with two other antennas. Second, the scattering properties of three probe antennas were determined by measuring two orthogonal components of their far-field patterns in both phase and amplitude. Third, the near fields of two X-band antennas were measured using the chosen probe. The measurement apparatus consists of an auto- - mated, line-scanning mechanical positioner capable of scanning a 100"" by 100"" planar surface with an accuracy of five thousandths of an inch. A newly developed phase/amplitude receiver was used to measure two ortho- gonal components of the near field in phase and amplitude. This informa- tion was read into a digital computer for low-pass filtering, wavenumber shifting, probe correction, and far-field calculation. Fourth, the calculated far fields of the two X-band antennas were compared to far-field patterns measured on a standard antenna range. Calculated and measured far-field patterns are shown to agree within the measurement accuracy of the far-field range. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Some electrophysiological experiments reveal the importance of excitatory and inhibitory transients. Moreover, visual masking experiments suggest that similar transient responses are active in temporal phenomena of human vision. To determine the role played by transient inhibition in masking and metacontrast, increment thresholds for 5 msec. foveal test flashes on an adapting field were obtained at various times before and after the onset of a 500 msec. masking annulus. Since the effectiveness of a brief test flash is a measure of the magnitude of the inhibitory transient at various points in its time course, the visual masking functions constructed from the threshold data represented an indirect picture of the temporal course of lateral inhibition. The results clearly demonstrated that increasing the retinal illuminance of the masking annulus increased the magnitude and decreased the latency of the peaks of the masking functions. As the retinal illumi- nance of the masking flash was increased by three log units, the peak masking effect for three observers shifted from test flashes presented 50 msec. after the mask onset to flashes presented simultaneously with the mask. The masking functions were interpreted in terms of a transient inhibition theory, and the results were compared with other visual masking theories. viii.

Burks A well-known version of the antinomy of the liar may be constructed by accepting all instances of the schema (1) "" "" is true if and only if and the empirical identity statement (2) The first sentence on B is ""The first sentence on B is not true"" where ""B"" abbreviates a description of some particular blackboard. The antinomy of the liar shows that we can not accept all instances of schema (1) for the use of the predicate ""is true"". Certain predicates, such as ""is necessary"" and ""is possible"", are called modal predicates because they ex- press what used to be known as ""modes\' of truth. The- ories of modal logic can be interpreted as providing us with schemata for the use of modal predicates. An exam- ple of such a schema is (3) If II "" is necessary, then . In the case of the schema for the use of the predi- cate ""is true"" we are enjoined from accepting self refe- rential instances. We would like to know if a similar injunction applies to the schemata for the use of modal predicates. We may ask our question in the following way Could there be an arrangement of sentences upon the blackboard B such that someone could derive a contradiction if he accepted the identity statements generated by that ar- rangement of sentences and the instances of the modal schemata of some theory of modal logic\' ? We construct a formal theory in which both the self referential instances of modal schemata of Lewis\' S5 and the identity statements are expressible. We prove that this theory, which we call SM, is consistent. The antinomy of the liar can be constructed in formal theories. A theory which has an arithmetic subtheory and a one-place predicate ""T(x) "" which is such that for any sentence S of the theory we can prove (4) T(nr(s)) S is inconsistent. Here ""nr(s)"" denotes the numeral of the theory which refers to the number associated with S by a system of Godel numbering. This result is usually refer- red to as Tarski\'s Theorem. Richard Montague has proven a theorem which says that if a formal theory of the sort mentioned above contains a one-place predicate ""N(x) "" for which we can prove for any sentence S (5) N (nr(s)) s, and instances of certain other schemata corresponding to theorems of Lewis\' S1, then the theory is inconsistent. We can obtain our informal version of the antinomy of the liar by ""translating"" the proof of Tarski\'s Theorem into ordinary English. It would seem that we ought to obtain a modal antinomy by so translating the proof of Montague\'s Theorem. In view of the consistency of SM, the proof of Montague\'s Theorem must employ principles which are not expressible in SM. Whether or not these principles are expressible in ordinary English involves the question of whether or not the syntax of ordinary English is finitely axiomatizable. We try to account for the fact that the theory SM is consistent while a theory which meets the conditions of Montague\'s Theorem is inconsistent. One difference be- tween the theories is in the naming conventions which they employ; quotation marks on the one hand and a Godel numbering on the other. In the case of the antinomies involving truth it makes no difference which naming con- vention is adopted. In the case of a modal antinomy the difference between using referentially opaque quotation marks and a referentially transparent Godel numbering may well be what determines whether or not such an antinomy can be constructed.']"

Smith and Francis C. Evans Non-breeding surplus in a territorial passerine was investigated by selectively removing territorial adult male Red-winged Blackbrids from several small marshes during several nesting seasons. A large number of the population, both within the removal marshes and in the surrounding marshes, were individually marked by color-banding, and included both sexes and all age classes. Observation of replacement of removed males and of the individually marked birds yielded data on density, survivorship, age specific production, nestling sex ratio, breeding sex ratio, male age class ratios, and dispersion. The data are discussed and formulated into a proposed hypothesis for the population structure of this species during nesting as follows: 1) Males select a breeding home range during the subadult year, possibly earlier, to which they return as adults and within which they seek territory. 2) Subadult males are for the most part behaviorally incapable of breeding regard- less of availability of habitat. 3) All yearling females probably do breed, but may lay fewer eggs on the average. 4) During breeding season approximately 1/2 of the adult males are territorial and breeding and 1/2 are non-breeding. 5) Subadult males occur in numbers approximating 1/2 - 2/3 the total adult male population. 6) At nesting the total of females, all of which nest, equals the total of males, which includes the breeding males, the excluded adult males and the subadult males, thus accounting for the degree of polygyny 2 in the nesting population. The study suggests but does not directly document the inferences that 1) the non-breeding males, including subadults, are organized within the terri- torial structure of the nesting population, and that 2) the exclusion of potentially breeding males is probably not a major factor in regulating the population size of this species.']"

Mark, Jr. & Walter J. Weber, Jr. The surface chemistry of activated carbons has long been a subject of dispute. A review section which critically discusses past data and conclusions regarding the nature of the surface oxygen functional groups on carbon is the beginning of this thesis. Extensive study of the adsorption phenomenon involving phenolic compounds in aqueous solution and activated carbon leads to a postulation of a weak donor-acceptor interaction between the relatively electron-poor aromatic ring and an electron-rich site on the carbon surface. It is suggested that the electron-donor surface site is that of a carbonyl oxygen group. Infrared internal reflectance spectroscopic (IRS) studies of several commercial, and several laboratory-prepared, activated carbons tend to support some of the theories regarding surface oxygen functional groups on activated carbons. The results of the infrared IRS studies of carbon black, powdered graphite, and several activated carbons are presented in the form of spectra, and discussed in terms of their band assign- ments. Adsorption bands characteristic of dicarboxylic acids, enolic forms of 1, 3-diketones and quinones have been observed on activated carbons. An Appendix discusses the basic theory behind the appli- cation of infrared IRS to the study of high-refractive index, highly absorbing, powdered solids.']"

Stern This study is an extension of the existing analysis of macro- economic policy and the balance of payments exemplified by the work of Professor Robert Mundell. It is argued that the Mundell analysis is applicable only in the short-run, since the Keynesian model on which it is based defines asset equilibrium in terms of flows rather than stocks and is thus incompatible with conditions of portfolio balance. It is further argued that existing attempts to correct this deficiency by imposing conditions of zero investment and constant asset stocks are equally untenable as descriptions of long- run equilibrium. In order to analyze the long-run effects of government policy in a situation of both portfolio balance of asset growth, a variant of the recently developed neoclassical monetary growth model is employed. That model is extended by adding interest bearing government debt and foreign financial assets to wealth portfolios and including interna- tional trade in goods. In this setting it is found most convenient to abandon the traditional Keynesian specification of government - 1 - - 2 - policy in terms of monetary and fiscal policy in favor of a specifi- cation in terms of debt management policy. In particular, government policy is defined in terms of three fundamental policy variables, the level, rate of growth, and composition of government debt, acting through three intermediate policy variables, the price level, the rate of inflation, and the bond interest rate. In this framework it is shown that the balance-of-payments effect of changes in the capital account depend importantly on the flow of interest earnings on foreign assets, this flow being roughly equal in size to the flow of new foreign investment. A distinction is drawn between real and nominal magnitudes and it is argued that, contrary to the conclusion of the static portfolio balance models, continuing capital flows at a constant income level are compatible with portfolio equilibrium when price flexibility is introduced. Composition-neutral increases in the overall level of government debt are shown to raise the level of the steady-state capital outflow and worsen the trade balance. The long-rur effects of changes in the composition of a given total debt on international capital and trade flows are shown to be significant but directionally uncertain, the results depending on savings behavior, conditions of production, and relative asset preferences. The influence of exchange rate flexibility is also investigated, and it is shown that differing rates of inflation between countries can be made compatible with balance-of-payments equilibrium through an appropriate steady crawl of the exchange rate. Central to this process is the direct effect of exchange rate variation on interna- tional capital flows acting through capital gains or losses. - 3 - Finally, the problem of the optimal composition of the balance of payments is examined. Here it is shown that purely financial capital flows have important effects on the real investment position, and that a policy of adjusting the capital account to accomodate the trade balance is sub-optimal.']"

A major objective of the study was to demonstrate that isothermal intrinsic reaction rates can be measured in a trickle-bed reactor. In all previously reported trickle-bed studies, porous catalysts have been used and thus reported reaction rates have included pore diffusion effects. In addition, previous work has shown that when highly exothermic reactions are studied in a dif- ferential bed reactor, significant temperature gradients can exist especially when active catalyst is concentrated in a small reactor volume.

Near-isothermal conditions were maintained in the reactor by diluting the active catalyst with inert granules of dolomite which served as a heat sink and liquid distributor. A bed height of 4.5 inches was used in a three inch I.D. Pyrex reactor. The average granule diameter was 1.61 mm. and the catalyst dilution ratio was 100 grams of catalyst to 600 grams of inert dolomite. Reaction rate data were obtained at 32, 40, and 50° C and at one atmosphere hydrogen pressure. The liquid feed stream consisted entirely of alpha-methylstyrene which flowed at rates between 100 and 225 cc./min. The hydrogen flow rate ranged from 1.0 to 2.5 liters/min. Effluent liquid phase compo- sition was determined with a gas chromatograph. It was found that the catalyst activity decreased with time due to poisoning of the catalyst surface by copper which had dissolved in the alpha-methylstyrene. The intrinsic reaction rate data was described, within an accuracy of about 10%, by a kinetic model which assumes plug flow in the liquid phase, the activity of the catalyst decreases exponentially with time, and the surface reaction rate is first order in hydrogen pressure.

The flights were contrasted mainly by different probe sizes to investigate the behavior of plasma sheaths. We have also incorporated the effects of contact potential variation (patch effect) over the probe surface, probe velocity, and vehicle potential in our interpretation of the data. Reasonable ion temperatures are obtained only if the above effects are considered. Our analysis also show that if the patch effect is neglected, the electron density and temperature would be overestimated, although this error is small in the latter case. We have found that electron densities range from approximately .8 X 10 5 /cc. to 4.0 X 105/cc.

Steinman Associate Professor The present research examined the relationship between noisy drift, corrective drift and smooth pursuit eye movements. Nachmias (1961) suggested that smooth pursuit of a moving target is controlled by the same low velocity system that corrects position errors pro- duced by noisy drifts during fixation of a stationary target. The present study examined this suggestion by recording two-dimensional eye movements with a contact lens-optical lever while 2 experienced subjects fixated and subsequently tracked a point target suddenly set into motion in 8 unpredictable directions at 6 constant veloci- ties (0.5 to 64 min arc/sec). A correlational technique was used to determine the degree to which drifts corrected position errors during fixation of a stationary target. A vector averaging procedure was used to determine the direction and velocity of smooth pursuits. It was found : firstly, slow drifts could be an appreciable source of compensation for position errors along all retinal meridians during the fixation of a stationary target. This finding is new, because prior research had shown that drifts corrected position errors only parallel to a few idiosyncratic directions. Another new result was the finding that 0.3 sec drifts could be as effective as saccades in correcting fixation position errors. Secondly, when targets moved Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. faster than 8-16 arc/sec, slow drifts became directionally uniform, moving the eye in the direction of the target at slightly less than target velocity. When the target moved more slowly than 8-16 min arc/sec, the eye drifted much faster than the target moved, and drift direction was not influenced by the direction of target motion. The changes in drift direction and velocity, which occurred when the target moved faster than 8-16 min arc/sec, were interpreted as evidence for a velocity threshold for smooth pursuit. The velocity threshold lay within the range of drift velocities observed during fixation of a sta- tionary target. This finding supports Nachmias\' suggestion that a single low velocity control system is responsible for both corrective drifts and smooth pursuits. A servomechanical model of low velocity eve movement control was developed to summarize the present results. The model incorporates all low velocity eye movements (noisy and corrective drifts as well as smooth pursuits) within a single descriptive framework. The main feat- ures of the model include: 1) a source of noisy drifts, which, when fast enough, initiate corrective drifts during fixation of a stationary target, 2) time-delay and low-pass components to simulate the response latency of the smooth eye movement system and the inability of the smooth system to follow very rapid changes in target position, 3) a differentiator to simulate the smooth pursuit velocity threshold and convert changes in target image position to velocity signals which guide low velocity corrective eye movements and 4) a Type ""o"" servo whose output velocity is always less than its input velocity.

A ""shelf"" feature of the a (T) curve is observed at several ultrasonic s frequencies. It is explained in terms of a Granato-Lücke model for amplitude- independent dislocation attenuation adapted to the superconducting state. Values are obtained for the damping force per unit length of the electron system on a dislocation loop and for the resonant frequency of the dislocation loops. At the highest frequencies another contribution of dislocation attenua- tion is identified. This attenuation is temperature-dependent, amplitude independent, and appears to be linear in frequency.

The main emphasis of the study was on the aspects of lens effects which had not been previounly investigated : (a) The behavior of the lenses at large transit times or rf frequencies for which the approximations of analytical theory are not valid. (b) The effects of posts (or grids) placed at one or both sides of the gap.

An analytical expression was also derived for the case where the downstream side of the lens is covered with a grid. The lens parameters, i.e. focal lengths and location of principal planes, were computed numer- ically for several geometries using electric field data obtained by computer with relaxation method. Computations were carried out for several two-dimensiona] and three-dimensiona] gap geometries at three different frequencies of the gap voltage as a function of kinetic energy and rf phase of the particles at the center of the gap.

At very low frequency the gap fields were found to be focusing over the entire half period of the rf during which acceleration occurs. As the frequency (or transit angle of the particles) increases the lenses become defocusing at large negative phases of the rf voltage. The phase angle, at which the transition from focus- - ing to defocusing takes place, shifts with increasing frequency in positive direction, i.e. the defocusing phase interval increases. Use of posts at the exit side of the gap improves the vertical focusing substantially at the expense of intro- ducing some defocusing in horizontal direction. In cyclotrons this horizontal defocusing poses no problem as sufficient horizontal focusing is available from magnetic force to counter- act this effect.

Doctor of Business Administration, 1970 Dissertation directed by William B. widhelm, Ph.D. Assistant Professor of Business Administration University of Maryland This dissertation develops a structured Markovian analysis of the quality characteristics of a large class of systems. Being Markovian, the proposed models require the use of state variables to describe the quality levels at various points 1n the system and transition matrices to describe the error-producing and error-detecting character- istics of the servers and machines that compose the system. Under these conditions, the models can predict the error+ level distributions of the various systems. Among the applications of this analysis are the design of systems for specified quality objectives, the selection of the optimal means of producing the same output when there are several means available, and the establishment of quality oriteria that can be used to evaluate system performance. The models can also be used to predict the effects on the error-level distribution due to changes in the quality of the incoming products, the performance characteristics of the operators or machines, and the quality reviewers. Ultimately, the model may be used to optimize the system's design by indicating the optimal number, type, and location of quality reviewers. In a sense, this dissertation can be considered an application of the principles of reliability engineering to systems design because it enables the analyst to measure the effects on the system's performance as the parameters are ranged.

The photostationary state lies entirely on the side of the trans isomer in the cases of direct irradiation at 3130 A or at 3660 A. The quantum yield at 3130 A is 0.00650 and does not vary with concentra- tion. In the presence of benzophenon as sensitizer the quantum yield is 0.00540. On the other hand, the quantum yield for direct irradia- tion at 3660 A decreases with increasing concentration of cis ß- styrylferrocene varying from 0.00365 to 0.00198. These results lead to the suggestion that the isomerization takes place from a triplet state of -styrylferrocene which probably has higher energy than the lowest triplet; reaction from the third triplet seems most likely.

T E B (H) is paranormal if for each Z contained in the resolvent set of T, -1// = 1 where d (z, o (T)) is the distance from Z to o(I), the spectrum of T. P contains the set n of normal operators and P contains the set of hyponormal operators. However, P is contained in L, the set of all I E B (H) such that the convex hull of the spectrum of T is equal to the closure of the numerical range of T. Thus, n U P ci L. If the uniform operator (norm) topology is placed on B(H), then the relative topological properties of n, P, and L can be discussed. In Section IV, it is shown that 1) n,P, and L are arc-wise con- nected and closed, 2) n,p, and L are nowhere dense subsets of (%) when dim H > 2, 3) n = P when dim H < 00, 4) n is a nowhere dense subset of P when dim H = 00 , , 5) P is not a nowhere dense subset of L when < 80, , and 6) it is not known if P is a nowhere dense sub- set of L when dim y = 8 . The spectral properties of paranormal operators are of current interest in the literature. Putnam [22, 23] has shown that certain points on the boundary of the spectrum of a paranormal operator are either normal eigenvalues or normal approximate eigenvalues. Stampfli [26] has shown that a hyponormal operator with countable spectrum is normal. However, in Theorem 3.3, it is shown that a paranormal opera- tor T with countable spectrum can be written as the direct sum, N . A, iv of a normal operator N with ((N) = (I) and of an operator A with o(A) a subset of the derived set of (()) It is then shown that A need not be normal. If we restrict the countable spectrum of T E P to lie on a c²-smooth rectifiable Jordan curve Go, then I must be normal (see Theorem 3.5 and its Corollary]. If T is a scalar paranor- mal operator with countable spectrum, then in order to conclude that T is normal the condition r(T) c Go can be relaxed [see Theorem 3.6]. In Theorem 3.7 it is then shown that the above result is not true when T is not assumed to be scalar. It was then conjectured that if T E P with J(I) c Go, then T is normal. The proof of Theorem 3.5 relies heavily on the assumption that T has countable spectrum and cannot be generalized. However, the Corollary to Theorem 3.9 states that if TEP with T (T) c Go, then T has a non-trivial lattice of invariant subspaces. After the completion of most of the work on this thesis, Stampfli [30, 31] published a proof that a paranormal operator T with o (T) EGo is normal. His proof uses some rather deep results concern- ing numerical ranges whereas the proof of Theorem 3.5 uses relatively elementary methods.']"

Both the forward and reverse bias char acteristics on CdTe are in good agreement with the two-band model for the energy vs. complex momentum relationship. The presence of trapping states increased the magnitude of the tunneling current at low voltage levels by providing a two-step transition. The s lope of the forward bias log J VS. V curves for tunneling through the intermediate states was reduced by a factor of 2 . The approximate density and energy of the trapping states was calculated from the observed J-V characteristics.

A calibration curve was established to determine the concentration of silicon in the matrix. The variation of the Si content of the Ni-rich matrix as a function of time follows Lifshitz and Wagner theory for diffusion controlled coarsening phenomena. The estimated values of equilibrium solubility of silicon in the matrix represent the true coherent equilibrium solu- - bilities. The experimental particle - size distributions and average par - ticle size were determined from dark field electron micrographs. The average particle size varies linearly with t as suggested by Lifshitz and Wagner. The experimental distributions of particle sizes differ slightly from the theoretical curve at the early stages of aging, but the agreement is satisfactory at the later stages. The values of diffu- sion coefficient of silicon, interfacial free energy and activation energy were calculated from the results of coarsening kinetics. The experi- mental value of effective diffusion coefficient is in satisfactory agree- - ment with the value predicted by the application of irreversible thermo - dynamics to the process of volume constrained growth of coherent pre- - cipitate during coarsening. The coherent y' particles in Ni-Sialloy unlike - those in Ni-Al and Ni-Ti seem to lose coherency at high temperature. A mechanism for the formation of semi-coherent precipitate is sug- gested.

Part II - ABSTRACT An alloy containing iron, phosphorous and carbon in the atomic concentrations corresponding to Fe75-P15-C10 can be obtained in the amorphous state by rapid quenching from the liquid state. The transformation of this alloy from the amorphous to the equilibrium crystalline state has been studied by thermal analysis, x-ray and electron diffraction, electronmicroscopy and electrical resistivity. At rates of heating above about 320°/min, the alloy transforms very rapidly into a microcrystalline structure with an average crystal size of about 300 A. At slightly lower rates (about 100° C/min) it is possible to stop the massive crystallization and microcrystalline clusters of metastable phases imbedded in an amorphous matrix are present. At a relatively low rate of heating of 1°C/min, crystallization starts around 375°C but has a sudden increase in the range of 420 to 440 °C. This increase in crystallinity is reflected in the electrical resistivity which also shows a sharp drop within the same.temperature range. Before this mas - sive crystallization takes place, the electrical resistivity increases slowly with temperature. This behavior has been observed pre- viously in a number of amorphous alloys. In the amorphous FePC alloy, this increase in resistivity is not a reversible phenomenon, and the results of the present investigations suggest that it is due to additional scattering of the conduction electrons by very small clus - ters of crystalline phases, about 508 in size.

The range of resolved shear stress was 0 to 15 mega- dynes /cm² for seven temperatures (66°K, 74°K, 83°K, 123°K, 173°K, 296°K, 373 °K). Dislocation mobility is characterized by two distinct features; (a) relatively high velocity at low stress (maximum velocities of about 9000 cm/sec were realized at low temperatures), and (b) increasing velocity with decreasing temperature at constant stress. The relation between dislocation velocity and resolved shear stress is: V = V o (-) T r where V is the dislocation velocity at resolved shear stress T . . , V 0 is a constant velocity chosen equal to 2000 cm/sec, To is the resolved shear stress required to maintain velocity V '' and n is the mobility coefficient. The experimental results indicate that To decreases from 16.3 X 106 6 to 3. 3 X 10 6 dynes/cm 2 and n increases from about 0.9 to 1. 1 as the temperature is lowered from 296°K to 66°K.

Typical conditions are: beam ion energy is 80 eV, ion density is 107-108 cm-3, electron temperature 1-3 eV, ion thermal speed very small compared to mean ion velocity. The dimensionless parameters closely approximate satellite flight conditions, with the exception of the electron-ion temperature ratio, which is near unity in flight and large in these experiments. The dependence of principal near wake features (such as the large ion current peak on the centerline behind the body) on the shape of the body was investigated systematically. All trends can be ex- plained qualitatively by recognizing the dominant role of those portions of the sheath where the free stream ion velocity is tangential to the body. The far wake of a strip (downstream of the ion current peak) displays a decaying radial distribution on the scale of the body size, somewhat similar to what is expected from a neutral gas. For axial symmetric models, the far wake displays a small structure on the scale of the ion current peak. The evolution of these disturbances is qualitatively explained by a simple, linearized two fluid theory. These features are initiated by the interaction of the inwardly deflected ion streams behind the body. At least in certain regions of the flow field, this interaction involves two-humped ion distribution functions, which may play a role in the further development of the far wake.

Slices of rat cerebral cortex were incubated with tritiated compounds, homogenized and sub- jected to subcellular fractionation. Some suspected neurotransmitters (glutamic acid, glycine, and norepine- phrine), the basic amino acids (arginine, lysine, orni- thine and histidine) and the small neutral amino acids (serine, alanine and threonine) were localized in particu- late fractions more than were others.

The dis- tribution of the amino acids in sucrose gradients were broader than that of norepinephrine, and this difference was enhanced by incomplete equilibrium sedimentation. In contrast to the synaptosomal localization of ³H-glutamic acid, endogenous glutamic acid was primarily localized in the soluble supernatant fraction. However, the particu- late moieties of exogenous and endogenous glutamic acid had identical patterns of distribution in continuous sucrose gradients, implying a mixing of exogenous with endogenous pools. All of the 3H-amino acids examined were mostly unmetabolized in the tissue slices, although meta- bolites of glutamic acid accumulated in the medium.

The first of two sets of subjects consisted of 30 mother-child pairs. The mothers were wives of either house staff or fellows of the Johns Hopkins Hospital and were native speakers of American English. The children were first- born boys; 10 children were a months old, 10 were 18 months old, and 10 were 28 months old. Speech data were obtained from each mother under two condi- tions. Condition A: the experimenter engaged the mother in conversation for 15 minutes. Speech recorded during Condition A is called ""A-speech"". Condition B: the mother and child engaged in free play for 15 minutes. Speech recorded during Condition B is called ""B-speech"". Ten measures were used to compare B-speech with A-speech and to compare B-speech addressed to children of one age with B-speech addressed to children of other ages. The measures included six syntactic measures (length of utterance, number of verbs per utterance, number of modifiers per utterance, proportion of function words, proportion of content words, and number of verb forms) and four vocabulary measures (type-token ratio, concreteness Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Speech addressed to 28-month boys was related to speech addressed to 18-month boys as A-speech was to B-speech. The second set of subjects examined consisted of six mother-child pairs. The mothers were wives of staff members of the Johns Hopkins and Baltimore City Hospitals. The children were first- and second- born boys between 27 and 33 months of age. Speech data were obtained from each mother under two conditions. In Condition A the mother read a story to the experi- menter; in Condition B the mother read the story to the child. Five sentences from this story were analyzed by sound spectrograph. Twelve measures were used to compare prosodic features of these sentences as read under Conditions A and B. The measures were mean fundamental frequency (ff), variance of ff, range of ff, maximum ff, minimum ff, number of inflections, extent of inflections, duration of inflections, rate of change of ff during inflections, time taken to utter the sentence, amount of time in Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

A-speech sentences had lower mean ff, smaller variance of ff, smaller range of ff, and lower maximum ff than the B-speech sentences, The B-speech sentences had more inflections, more extensive inflections, and more rapidly changing ff during inflections than the A-speech sentences. The B-speech sentences were also longer in total utterance time, in amount of voiced time, and in amount of unvoiced time. From this study we can conclude that there are differences in syntax, vocabulary and intonation between speech addressed to adults and speech addressed to children. Furthermore, these differences change with the age of the person addressed. The language addressed to children during the period in which they develop basic language skills is specialized and not represen- tative of the language spoken by adults among themselves.

181,,"kuo, albert yi-shuong",ph.d.,mechanics,experiments on the internal intermittency in turbulent flow,the johns hopkins university,1970,"['ARSTRACT Spatial ""intermittency"" in the velocity field fine-structure of fully turbulent flow regions was first observed by Batchelor and Townsend¹ in 1949. This phenomenon is studied further here, in particular in grid-generated, nearly isotropic turbulence and on the axis of a round jet. The ""small eddies"" concentrate in ran- dom domains occupying only a fairly small fraction of the fluid volume. Appropriately filtered hot-wire anemometer signals appear intermittent as the turbulent patterns are convected past the hot- wire by the mean flow. Measurements show the decrease in fine- structure volume as Reynolds number increases or as the size of the eddies studied decreases. The average linear dimension of these fine-structure regions turns out to be large compared with the sizes of the eddies with which they are active. This relative dimension decreases with increasing Reynolds number or with de- creasing eddy size. To study more about the statistical geometry of the fine- structure regions, two-probe coincidence functions for the occur- rence of fine-structure were measured as functions of the relative positions of the two probes. Three possible categories of geometry were considered: (a) ""blobs, n (b) ""rods,\' n (c) ""slabs, "" depending on whether the three mean orthogonal dimensions of the domains (a) are all of the same order, (b) show one an order larger than the other two, (c) show one an order smaller than the other two. ii Highly idealized paradigis for these three categories were computed analytically. The coincidence functions were computed for the cases of (a) spheres or (b) circular cylinders or (c) plane slabs, each ficld having random sizes distributed randomly in space with a homogeneous and isotropic statistical distribu- tion. Comparison of the actual turbulence data with these three paradigms suggests that the fine-structure regions are more likely to have random ""rod-like"" geometry than either of the other two. The flatness factors and probability distributions of the first derivative, the second derivative, and band-pass signals of the velocity fluctuations were also measured in grid-generated turbulence and on the axes of round jets. The turbulence Reynolds numbers Rx ranged from 12 to 830. The flatness factors of the velocity derivatives are sensitive to the high cut-off frequency of the electronic circuits. With high cut-off frequency set at Kolmogorov-scale frequency, the flatness factors of the first deriv- 0.2 0.62 ative vary with Rx for Rx < 200, vi th Rx for Rx> 500, and with a transition between these two ranges. Those of the second Rx 0.25 derivative vary with for Rx < 100 and with Rx 0.75 for Rx> 300. No sign of approaching asymptotic values was observed at Rx up to order of one thousand; this is contrary to the conjec- ture of absolute constant values at high Reynolds number made by Batchelor and Townsend. 1,9 The probability distributions of velocity fluctuations and large-scale signals are nearly normal, while the small-scale signals iii are not. The deviation from normality increases as we examine smaller and smaller scales extracted from the complete signal by proper filtering. The flatness factor of the filtered band-pass signal of the velocity fluctuation increases with incroasing fro- quency, while that of Gaussian noise is approximately 3.0 irre- spective of the frequency. The flatness factor of a band-pass sig- nal is dominated by the filter\'s smoothing (or averaging) effect if the filter bandwidth is very narrow. In the limit of infinitely narrow bandwidth, the application of the central limit theorem sug- gests that the band-pass signal is normal. The square of the signal associated with large wave numbers may be approximated by a log-normal probability distribution except for very small and very large amplitude ranges. iv c']"

Two versions of the game were employed in the research, with deviant behaviors in Version I highly visible and highly rewarding, while these behaviors in Version II are less visible but also less rewarding. The design was fully crossed on the variables of Race (white and black), socioeconomic status, or SES (middle and lower), and Version (I and II), with an equal number of dyads (6) in each of the cight cclls of the 2x2x2 design. A control group of twenty-four male students, matched with the ex- perimental group on the variables of Race and SES, and the experi- mental group were asked a series of questions about their perceptions of parental punitiveness. No significant difference between the responses of the experimental and control group was found. Bchavioral measures of the dyads' play in the game were collected and analyzed, with Race and SES shown to be significant factors only in three types of behaviors': (1) agreements in accor- dance with the interests of the child, (2) agreements in accordance with the interests of the parent, and (3) points received as a child. Version was shown to be a statistically significant variable in ten of thirteen analyses of dyad game behaviors. A significant Race x SES interaction in the questionnaire responses was revealed.

Movement of both the air phase and the water phase is considered. The treatment is made possible by assuming that capil - lary pressure can be partially neglected. When the continu- ity equation, and Darcy's law for each phase are combined with the assumption that capillary pressure can be neglected, an equation involving saturation displacement and an average total velocity, as the unknowns, is obtained. A second equa- tion, involving these two unknowns, is obtained by combining the capillary pressure relationship, and Darcy's law for each phase, and then integrating at a fixed time t. These two relationships are solved in a step-wise manner to yield the saturation profile, and then the infiltration rate, at time t. Soil properties and relationships which are required for the analysis are porosity, intrinsic permeability, relative permeability versus saturation relationships, and the capil- lary pressure versus saturation relationship. Infiltration rate curves are obtained for a number of situations involving different boundary and/or initial con- ditions. Comparisions are made with experimental results, as well as with results obtained from a finite difference solu- tion.

Absorption of 210 PoO2 in soils studied by bulk determination of distribution coefficients (Kg) indicated retention in the top soil samples was correlated with silt con- tent. An empirical equation describing agricultural top soil absorption was derived as ln Kd = 3.2 + 0.046 (percent silt). The distribution coefficients of the combined data for the A, B and C horizons combined were correlated with soil pH and silt content and could be described by the derived empirical equation ln Kd = - 1.3 + 0.034 (percent silt) + 0.88 (pH). Polonium oxide was eluted through soil columns and successfully tested these distribution coefficients. Greater than 98 percent of the 210 PoO2 was retained by the first 2 cm of soil with Kd's greater than 210 100. Top soil samples with Kd's less than 100 indicated PoO2 would be retained by the lower soil horizons. Hazards to water supplies by movement of 210 Po through soil would be minimal.

Absorbance decreases of the absorbing species of cerium were timed and these data were used to determine metal ion dependence, acid dependence, effect of changing ionic strength and the thermodynamic parameters. The metal ion dependence of the cerium (IV)-vanadium (IV) reaction was studied in both excess cerium (IV) perchlorate and excess oxovanadium (IV) perchlorate. The acid dependence was studied in excess V(IV) over the range 0.0615 to 4. .00 M in perchloric acid. The apparent second order rate constant was found to decrease with increasing acidity. Ionic strength was varied from 0. 100 M to 2.50 M at a constant acid strength of 0. 100 M. The increase in ionic strength by adding lithium perchlorate resulted in a linear increase in the apparent second order rate constant.

When non- additivity in the model is demonstrated to be present, the procedure has been to find a transformation which will make the transformed data additive. It seems that there is merit in performing an analysis of the data in the original units, if only for ease of interpretation. The pro- cedure recommended in this thesis is to examine the data to find the pattern of interaction and to obtain a usable estimate of the error variance. Two specific solutions for analyzing the data are given. In one solution it is assumed that the interaction is of the form Yij = raiy; for every i and j. In this case maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are obtained and a likelihood ratio test of Ho: : A = 0 is derived. The distribution of the likelihood ratio test is discussed and an estimate of the error variance is proposed when there is non-additivity in the data. The second solution is a completely general procedure in which a theory of two by two table differences is presented and then used to propose estimates of the error variance that have desirable properties. Two examples illustrating the procedures are also presented.

However, the application of active filters at higher pole frequencies has been limited by both the frequency dependence and the temperature dependence of the open loop gain of silicon integrated amplifiers. As a result, active filters have serious frequency and temperature limitations. This thesis considers n-th order single amplifier filters and shows that their frequency and temperature limitations are caused by the dependence of the filter poles on the finite, temperature- dependent gain-bandwidth product of the amplifier. A new pole sensi- tivity measure, Mp, is defined. This new sensitivity measure takes into account both the frequency and temperature dependence of the amplifier and thus leads to a quantitative figure of merit, IMP I , for integrated active filters. The sensitivity measure, Mp, is shown to depend only on the leading coefficient and the zeros of a specific driving point admittance of the passive RC network. Expressions for practical lower bounds for 1Mpl and for the minimum gain-bandwidth product required to realize a given transfer function are determined. The identification of the specific passive network parameters which affect the sensitivity measure, Mp results in a new synthesis procedure for the realization of a given transfer function by an active filter with specified sensitivity properties (e.g. zero Q-sensitivity). iii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Moreover, the use of the new sensitivity measure, Mp, and the expres- - sions for the lower bounds for the figure of merit, MM/, , lead directly to the modification of existing design procedures to achieve active filters with minimum 1Mpl.

A national sample of 1427 Americans was given Rokeach's value survey (Rokeach, 1967) The scale was then translated into Vietnamese and given to a randomly selected group of 349 Vietnamese living in South Vietnam shortly before the fall of the Saigon government. Differences between Vietnamese respondents as a function of the following demographic variables were examined: 1) gender, 2) religion, 3) education, 4) age, 5) occupation, 6) place of residence, and 7) income. Relative to Vietnamese women, Vietnamese men were more concerned with their personal freedom and personal accomplishment. Vietnamese women were more concerned with family-oriented values than men and gave evidence of having internalized a subservient role in society. College-educated Vietnamese, young Vietnamese, civil servants and Vietnamese living in cities showed more Western-oriented value systems than their counterparts. Religion and income did not produce any comparable differences. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

This difference was even more pronounced when Vietnamese women were compared with American women. Finally, it was found that the college- educated Vietnamese respondents were more like their American counterparts than were less educated Vietnamese. Further, in many respects, the values of college-educated Vietnamese were more similar to Americans' values than to other Vietnamese.

195,annie w. ward,"seligsohn, harriet cohen",ph.d.,education,academic advising: an approach to evaluation.,university of south florida,1976,"['ABSTRACT It has been well documented in the literature that there is a need for student personnel services in higher education but it has not been possible to show that such services are effective. This dilemma may be one reason student personnel services are given such a low priority in the allocation of resources, especially during times of economic crises. For those who believe that many student services are an integral part of the instructional process, perhaps the only means for survival of these, services is to develop ways to evaluate their effectiveness. Along with a willingness to implement evaluation techniques, there must be a commitment on the part of the participants in the system being evaluated to change and improve in the directions dictated by the findings. The purpose of this paper is to suggest an approach, ODAS, for the evaluation of a student service, academic advising in particular, with the intent of pointing the way to the development of a flexible, comprehensive system for evaluation of student services; a system that is applicable to various structures of a service and to any location; one that is not prohibitively expensive. With this purpose in mind, the investigator reviewed the pertin- ent literature. Several important problems which emerged were as follows: - There are conflicting purposes for conducting evaluations. - There is a lack of training of student personnel workers to conduct evaluations. viii - Often inappropriate criteria are used where evaluations are carried out. - There is a lack of definition of functions and goals of student personnel services. - There is confusion in the goals and uses of evaluation in relation to other kinds of research. - There is a lack of participation in the evaluation process by those evaluating and those being evaluated. - There is a lack of time to develop evaluation procedures. - Existing procedures fail to consider the unique characteristics of individuals in the evaluation process. These problems were taken into consideration to the extent possible in the development of the ODAS. In order to reaffirm the need for evaluation processes and to as- certain the purposes and subpurposes for which evaluations are or should be conducted, the investigator conducted a survey. From the survey re- sponses and from the literature, a list of purposes and subpurposes was developed. From this list, one purpose, ""Efforts to Meet the Needs of the Clientele,"" was selected and a series of objectives was derived. Techniques and items for assessing each objective from various sources of data were devised. The product consisted of a series of tables, one for each subpur- pose, containing objectives, items of data, assessment techniques, and sources of data (origin of the acronym ODAS). To use the product, one would: 1. Select at least one subpurpose for the evaluation. 2. Select from the table for that particular subpurpose all the ob- jectives which are consistent with the goals and philosophy of the unit and institution conducting the evaluation. 3. Use the corresponding items of data to construct the various in- struments needed, i.e., questionnaires, interview schedules, observation tallies, etc., for each source of data listed. ix 4. Conduct the evaluation. 5. Summarize the data. 6. Evaluate the results. 7. Provide feedback to the participants. 8. Make necessary changes in the unit\'s activities. 9. Continue the procedure for other subpurposes and after changes have been made and used for a while, re-evaluate the same sub- purposes. To confirm the validity of the ODAS, experts in the fields of student personnel services, measurement, and academic advising were asked to give their professional opinions on the various aspects of the project. The investigator also conducted a pilot test as an initial check of the feasibility of the ODAS. A number of limitations were identified: - Not all of the objectives could be appropriately assessed. - The objectives for a particular subpurpose were not all-inclusive. - Some of the objectives were broadly stated, but only narrowly assessed. Recommendations included further development of the system by the professionals in the field and implementation ideas such as the use of organization development, a phase-in process, and matrix sampling tech- niques.

196,you-feng lin,"rose, david alon",ph.d.,mathematics,on generalizations of continuity.,university of south florida,1977,"['ABSTRACT Generalized continuity conditions for functions between topological spaces have been investigated almost from the beginning of the century. Recently, an increased interest has been taken in these conditions weaker than continuity both to explore the conditions themselves with their innate properties and interrelationships and to use these conditions as tools for characterizing certain classes of topological spaces. Two of the prominent independent generalized conti- nuity conditions are weak continuity and almost continuity for which new characterizations are found. Conditions for interdependence of these two generalizations of continuity are also found. A mapping condition is sought which when combined with almost continuity will yield continuity. This leads to the notion of strong semi-continuity It was known that weak continuity plus weak* continuity is equivalent to continuity. Here weak* continuity is replaced by local weak* continuity whereby a pure topo- logical version of the closed graph theorem is obtained for a function into a strongly locally compact space. Many theorems treated individually in the literature are shown to have a common basis from which they stem. Thus vi a unification of some of the heretofore disjointed results is established. Shwu-Yeng T. Lin and You-Feng Lin recently found the following mapping characterization of Baire spaces. THEOREM (L-L)1. A topological space X is a Baire space if and only if every function :X+Y on X into a second countable infinite regular Hausdorff space Y has a dense set of points of almost continuity D(f) in X. Theorem (L-L)1 has a common origin with the recent results on Blumberg spaces. In fact this theorem provides a new proof of the known result that the Blumberg spaces are Baire spaces. The notion of a C1 (C2) space is introduced and investigated for the purpose of improving Theorem (L-L)1. The improved version states that a topological space X is a Baire space if and only if every function on X into a second countable infinite Hausdorff space Y has a dense set of points of almost continuity.

The reduced aromatic hydrocarbon, a radical anion, induces the decomposition of the bulk oxidant precursor into a reactive radical oxidant, the benzoyloxy radical. When the benzoyloxy radical oxidizes a radical anion to the neutral species, there exists an excess of energy in the reaction which is sufficient to cause the neutral aromatic hydrocarbon to be electronically excited to the triplet energy state. The triplet state molecule then reacts with BPO forming the cation radical of the aromatic hydrocarbon. The cation radical undergoes an annihilation reaction with an anion radical pro- ducing two neutral molecules of the aromatic hydrocarbon. However, there exists sufficient excess energy in this reaction to excite one of the molecules to an electronically excited state. If the amount of this excess energy is large enough, then the lowest excited singlet state is produced and luminescence is detected from its radiant decay; otherwise a triplet state is formed, again. As the population of triplet molecules increases triplet-triplet annihilation occurs produc- ing an excited singlet state and a ground state molecule, the former luminescing. xii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Electro- chemiluminescence is observed for a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons and binary mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons. Finally, a mathematical derivation of the time dependency of the emission intensity is presented based on the mechanism. Experimental intensity-time data are fitted by means of a nonlinear least squares analysis to the derived intensity- time function. The analysis of the results indicates: the triplet species undergoes a quenching reaction which does not lead to luminescence, and the induced decomposition of BPO and the anion-cation annililation re- action are diffusion controlled.

Of these four approaches, rote memorization has been determined to be ineffective and mathematically unsound even when recal! of the basic multipli- cation facts is the primary consideration. Two of the three remaining methods, textbook instruction and manipulative instruction, have been compared with respect to their relative effectiveness in facil- itating recall of the facts and comprehension of the concept of multi- plication. The results of these comparisons have been conflicting. The last method, instruction using mnemonic devices has not been re- searched. The purpose of this study was to compare three approaches to multiplication instruction--textbool instruction, manipulative in- struction and imagery (a mnemonic method) -- and to determine their relative efficacy when recall of the basic multiplication facts was the primary objective. To effect this comparison, three treatments were designed to be representative of the three approaches to multiplication instruction: Treatment T, textbook instruction, used multiplication pages from the Holt School Mathematics (Nichols, et al., 1974) third-grade text.

Treatment M, manipulative instruction, was designed with the learner\'s developmental level in mind. Concrete materials were available to the child at all times during instruction. Work sheets emphasizing mathe- matical meaning were used. Treatment 1, imagery, consisted of an analytic substitution system to code the digits 0 through 9 into sounds, and a set of pictures (images) for the multiplication facts. The child remembered ""two COWS jumping rope"" to recall the fact 117 x 7 = 49"". Although recall of the basic multiplication facts was the primary concern, comprehension and attitude measures were taken at the end of the study. Treatments were randomly assigned, one to each of three second-grade classes (total n = 76). The investigator conducted all instruction. Treatments were conducted for twenty-three, forty- five minute periods; a recal! test was administered weekly. A repeated-measures design was employed. Three hypotheses were tested in the study: 1. There will be no significant difference on mean gain in recall of the basic multi- - plication facts for students taught by a textbook method, a manipu- lative method or an imagery method; 11. there will be no significant occasion effect or occasion by treatment interactions; 111. there will be no significant difference in treatment group centroids of recall, comprehension and attitude for students taught by a textbook method, a manipulative method or an imagery method. To test the three hypotheses, recent MAT raw scores were used as covariates in both analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) and multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA).

There was a significant difference in recall over time between the adjusted mean recall score for mani- - pulatives and that for imagery, the manipulative adjusted mean score being higher. Hypothesis 11 was accepted for occasions, the effect of the repeated-measures on recall was not significant. Hypothesis 11 for occasion by treatment interaction was rejected, indicating treat- ment growth curve interaction. An analysis of trends indicated that treatment-growth curve interaction could be represented by no greater than second-degree polynomials. Hypothesis 111 was rejected. Final recall and comprehension adjusted mean scores did not differ significantly, but those for attitude did. The adjusted mean score for attitude for manipulatives was significantly more positive than that for textbook instruction. Recommendations of the study call for the use of more manipulatives in the early-elementary classroom and further investi- gation of the use of imagery with smaller, or more specialized groups.

The highest summits on the eastern divide of the basin (>3850 m) were glaciated during the Late Quaternary. During wetter phases the lakes united to form a single waterbody which over- flowed into the Awash River to the north via the Meki-Dubeta col (ca. 1670 m). Past water-level fluctuations have been established using three main approaches: 1) a detailed geomorphic and bathymetric investigation of the former lake bed and shorelines, based on field and air-photo studies; 2) stratigraphic 14 description and C dating of the Rift-floor sediments and 3) a limited investigation of depositional environments. Changes in lacustrine conditions have also been related to variations in ice extent, vegetation and soils within the catchment area. Four major lacustrine highstands and six minor ones have occurred since 30,000 BP. These can be grouped into a complex Late Pleistocene lacustral interval (ca. 30,000 to ca. 21,000 BP) and a complex postglacial lacustral interval (ca. 11,500 to ca. 4800 BP); separated by a prolonged period of aridity. Since 4800 BP, lake levels have remained low and fluctuating, apart from a brief late Holocene maximum after 2500 BP. Overflow into the Awash occurred intermittently during the intervals ca. 24,000 - ca. 21,000 BP, 9400 - 8500 BP and 6500 - 4800 BP. Because the topography of the basin has remained relatively stable over the last 30,000 years, it is possible to interpret these fluctuations in climatic terms, although this is not valid for earlier periods. A simple water-balance model has been used to compute the changes in rainfall and runoff required to sustain the lakes at different times. This indicates that precipitation has + varied by at least - 25% since 20,000 BP.

The first approach utilized gene markers, especially those of chromosome two, to locate effects of earliness in the tomato genome. The second method employed seven varieties selected for their range of values in the expression of maturity, plus the 21 possible hybrids, and analyzed by constant parent regression techniques. The final method involved two varieties, their F1, F2, and F3 generations and partitioned total phen- typic expression into additive, dominance, epistatic, and environmental effects. It was determined that the major genes for maturity were located on the number two chromosome with at least two distinctly separate regions. One region, associated with the mottled and dwarf gene markers, was approximately twice as influential as the other which was closely associated with the marker compound inflorescence. All three components showed similar results. Each component, however, contributed unequally to total maturity i. e. as measured in days from seeding to ripe fruit. A non- additive effect was found between the two defined regions of chromosome two in the components first bloom and fruit set. All analyses were completed on the original scale as measured in days. Scaling tests indicated that a transformation of the data could simplify the analyses, but a satisfactory scale could not be found in which all loci would become additive. Care had to be given, therefore, to extract interaction effects. It was found that early maturity genes were completely dominant to their late phase alleles in the components ripe fruit and fruit set, and partially dominant in the component first bloom. The interaction or epistatic effects in segregating generations were of the same magnitude as those of additivity. For the component first bloom the two regions of chromsome two which had effects on maturity could be regarded as being equiva- lent to two genes, one having twice the value of the other. With the added information provided from partitioning methods a hypothetical F2 distribution was calculated which included epistatic effects. The hypothetical and actual F2 distributions were in very good agrecment.

A hypothetical F2 distribution was calculated in the same fashion as that calculated for the component first bloom. The agreement between the hypothetical and the actual distributions was not clear. The total F2 distribu- tion consisted of four replications and independent tests were made on each. The results were inconsistent due to heterogene- ity. Nevertheless, the premises upon which the hypothetical distribution was based were concluded as the most reasonable under the conditions of the experiment. The analysis of the component fruit set was not as thorough because of the shortcomings associated with it. Measurement of this component in whole days was found to be too crude to justify extensive analysis. It was concluded that because a scale which would render all loci additive could not be found, the most important single aspect to come from these analyses was that of evaluating inter- action (epistasis). In the component first bloom two types of epistasis were detected. A homozygous locus interacting with a heterozygous locus with a heterozygouslocus interaction by another approach. In the component ripe fruit, only a heterosygous- heterozygous type interaction could be positively identified, whereas in the component fruit set the interactions were similar to those of first bloom. As the environment was not constant through all components it played a significant role in diversify- ing genetic behavicr. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

By using a new design of the free-molecule pressure probe it has been possible to get accurate measurements of molecular speed ratio in the flow field near the plate. By using this probe in consort with an equilibrium temperature probe it has proved possible to determine both speed-ratio and static temperature at all points in the flow. By suitable calculations it is then possible to determine all other flow parameters as de- sired. It has been shown that the equilibrium temperature probe response is very sensitive to slight departures from adiabatic flow and is therefore unreliable in boundary layers when used to determine speed-ratio. Errors in the measurements have been carefully considered. The ""two-stream"" type distribution function has been con- sidered and its effect on probe response near a wall investigated, making certain simple assumptions about molecular interactions with a wall. It has been shown that for accommodation coefficients and flow conditions present in these experiments. the effect of a two-stream response on probe measurements is not significantly different from that of a simple Maxwellian distribution with the same average properties for T and S. A theoretical solution for flow around the leading edge of a flat plate has been developed which agrees with the experi- mental data. In this solution, the ""Rayleigh problem"" has been solved explicitly for the ""modified"" or ""single-relaxation-time"" form of the Boltzmann equation. It has been shown that this solution can apply only in a somewhat restriced way, but that within these limits the solution should be meaningful. Expressions for slip-velocity and temperature-jum have been obtained. It has been shown that the Maxwell slip-conditions are incompatible with this solution. An analysis has been made of the flow around the leading edge of the flat plate, with and without heat addition. It has. been possible to show that: 1) The boundary-layer begins to form well ahead of the leading edge, with a measurable effect as much as ten mean-free paths ahead. This is a true boundary-layer effect and propagates forward by a diffusion of the disturbance. 2) The Maxwell slip conditions probably do not hold near the leading edge. 3) To the same degree, the temperature-jump conditions to not hold near the leading edge.

Values of accommodation obtained tend to agree with values quoted in the literature for ""clean"" surfaces rather than for normal ""engineering surface. A detailed investigation has been made of the use of constant temperature thermocouple vacuum gauges in low-density wind tunnels. Several designs have been tried, the most successful being an all-metal design with an extremely small internal volume and a high sensitivity. The high precision and small internal volume of this gauge has been applied to free- molecule pressure probes. The small size of these probes allows them to be used in higher density flows than heretofore possible, thus extending the range of usefulness of the free- molecule pressure probe. Details of a technique to allow construction of even finer probes have been described. Another application of these gauges has been described in which the sensing element is embedded in a glass plate less than 1/8"" thick. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

It is rather difficult to give technically correct definition of a variety. As a working definition, by variety we mean a separate and distinguishable type of grain, alloy, drug, or a strain of bacteria, as the case may be. In this work the twin problems of selection and screen- ing of varieties are considered. In selection, we are given a number (k) of varieties and we are required to select the best or it' (t<1 k) best varieties. On the other hand, in screening, we are interested in all the varieties which are above a certain level or in some cases we may be interested in retaining a certain specified fraction of the population of the varieties. The traditional analysis of variance procedure is not very suitable for selection problems, because when the experimenter knows a priori that the varieties are differ- ent there is no purpose in testing the hypothesis of homo- geniety. The criterion for selection is the sample yield, and yield is supposed to be a continuous variable. On each variety a number of observations are taken; the number Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. V of observations is the same for all varieties. The variety which gives the maximum sample mean is taken to be the best. The formulation of the selection problem will depend upon the a priori information available and the purpose in hand. In the absence of any information about the means of the varieties it may be desirable to formulate the problem in terms of least favourable configuration. The least favourable configuration expression is used for the situation when all the varieties are just 8 (specified) inferior to the best variety. If some information a priori is available it should be utilized. We assume that each observation on a variety is normal with unknown mean and known variance and the varietal means themselves follow some distribution. Three distributions, exponential, gamma and double exponential are investigated. Three formulations of the selection problem are considered, (a) probability of correct selection under all circumstances, i.e., the probability that the best variety is selected, (b) probability of correct selection under the condition that the best variety exceeds all others by a certain specified 6, and (c) the probability that the selected variety is with- in & of the best. Numerical results are obtained for k = 2 for the probability of correct selection and those have been compared with normal distribution and least favourable con- figuration results. The least favourable configuration re- sults are obtained by taking the difference of the two means Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The normal distribution gives higher values than the other distributions but, the difference is not much. It appears that for k = 2 the probability of correct selection does not depend much upon the distribution and this is part- icularly so if the probability of correct selection is high. For the exponential distribution an alternative form- ulation of the probability of correct selection is given; from that the interesting result we get is that the probability of the r-th best variety exceeding the other varieties is independent of K ( rc k) . A procedure is given by which the probability of correct selection for the exponential distribution can be obtained for all k, provided the error variance is such that the pro- bability of correct selection is of the order of 90%. The same method has been adopted to get the numerical values for k up to 4 in case of double exponential and for k = 3 in case of normal. A number of miscellaneous selection problems, such as optimum size of the experiment when the varietal means follow exponential distribution; selecting of it' best varieties and complete ranking of the varieties, are considered. Finally, selection based upon two characters is considered. The second part of the Thesis deals with screening pro- blem. Screening is in comparison with a standard, i.e., only Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. VII those varieties are selected which exceed the standard by a certain specified amount. Firstly, we deal with first stage screening. Three distributions, normal, exponential and double exponential are considered. Our object in screening is to have an increase in the mean yielding cap- acity of the selected varieties over the whole population. The gain in the mean yielding capacity expressed in units of the standard deviation of the distribution under study has been termed as standard gain. For the three distributions mathematical formulae are derived for the fraction selected and the standard gain obtained; numerical results are ob- tained for the same. The general inference from the numer- ical results we get is that if Oo is the standard de- viation of the parent population, E 2 0 ; o is the error = n variance) is not very large (< 1.0) and cut-off point is such that 1/10 or less of the population is selected, the fraction selected is almost the same for the three dis- tributions. However, the standard gain is higher in the exponential distribution. The gain is the expected gain; an expression for the variance of the standard gain is ob- tained; it depends upon the error variance and the number of varieties tested.

The use of non-linear elements to reduce the depadence of the system res- ponse on plant parameters is studied. A non-linear feedback approach to performance invariance is analyzed in detail, and new configurations to produce approximate invariance are presented. The schemes depend on the extraction of information about the current plant situation and the use of this data to modulate the system input so that the plant drive will compensate for the parameter variations. The components of the proposed schemes are system models, phase coordinate transducers and arithmetic comparators including dividers and multipliers. As compared with the conventional ap- proach of closing high-gain feedback loops around the plant, the proposed schemes present no stability problems with high order plants, and allow the use of appropriate filters to attenuate trans- ducer noise in the system output. The schemes are grouped into two classes - the one dealing with gain variations, the second with the variations in any other parameters. Members of each group are similar in construction. The simple one-parameter scheme is relatively insensitive to slight deviations in the non-compensated parameters. Compounding can be used to extend the schemes to handle situations in which two para- meters vary substantially. Extension to certain types of linear systems with many inputs and outputs is also included. The Lapluce transform is used for synthesis of these schemes with the assumptions that the parameter variations are restricted to be piece-wise constant and the initial conditions on all other variables are zero. A time domain analysis is also included. The systems were described by differential and integro-differentia] equations, and in some special cases through the use of simplifying assumptions they were reduced to known forms. A simulation study was conducted to verify the analytic conclu- sions and to examine situations that are difficult to analyze. Both analogue and digital techniques were employed and the results sub- stantiated the conjectures and the analysis concerning the adequacy of the configurations in coping with parameter variations.

The thesis contends that Blake\'s metaphors, images, and symbols describe the creative process, and that his poetry dramatizes and illustrates a conception of art. The thesis stops short of criticizing Blake\'s axioms, but tries to discuss the inter-relation between ideas and themes and the symbols which incorporate those ideas. Irony and paradox are seen throughout to inform Blake\'s system of symbols and the way in which he uses a symbol, image, or metaphor. In essence, then, the concern is with the ""creative theme"" in Blake\'s poetry and the symbols in which it is embodied. The thesis is composed of ten chapters, divided into two parts: the first part discusses ""the creative theme"" and the second ""the symbols of the creative theme"". Part One is concerned mainly with Blake\'s conception of the poet and his ideas about the nature of creative action. Blake believed that creativity originated with the imagination, and that no creation could be performed without the imagination. Furthermore, he appears to believe that only in the imagination is there a reconciliation between the symbol and that for which the symbol stands. Since a work of art in the broad- est sense is a crystallization, art becomes for Blake the means by which man realizes his creativity, his sense of identity, the quality of his mind. The identity of the poet or the artist depends upon the scope and intensity of his imagination. Part Two, which is the main body of the thesis, is devoted to an examination of Blake\'s creative images and symbols, particularly as these appear in Milton and Jerusalem; purpose is to provide a guide to the sym- bolic figures in Blake\'s major poetry. In discussing Blake\'s conception of the creative process, I have stressed certain themes. I argue that the creative process is seen as a unifying action which integrates aspects of a fully ex- perienced totality. Secondly, Blake\'s eternity of art would presup- pose an eternity of mind whose inward dialogue identifies word and object. Thirdly, Blake\'s poet is one who achieves continual renewal through a revelation or vision of ""All that Exists"". His poet, too, is a prophet who effects an identification of personal and impersonal perspectives. Finally, because he draws upon the eternal forms of the imagination, the poet in any age describes the creative experi- ence. (Cont\'d.) Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

First, we find the ""union-disunion"" myth which has as its symbolic focus the figure of the ""cosmic man"" or ""fallen giant"". Essentially, this myth re- verses Plato\'s allegory of the cave, since Blake deals not with an ascent from a shadowy world-womb but the descent into it. Secondly, he exploits an ""Orc myth"", which interprets the tragic as well as the cyclical nature of fallen existence. This myth portrays a struggle between reason and desire, the tyrant and the rebel. Such a ""dialectic"" spawns new theses which are the parents of antitheses. Orc logic is Hegelian, and the final synthesis is always out of sight. Thirdly, we observe the myth of the ""transforming presence"" which has as its symbolic focus the figure of woman. Her nature is twofold. In one aspect she is Vala-Rahab or Babylon, the Lamia, the seductress or virgin-whore sans merci. In her other aspect, she is Jerusalem, the emanation, the daughter of her own son. These three patterns of myth portray the same experience from different points of view. All Blake\'s poetry is, like Jerusalem, quasi-critical. Crea- tion encompasses the totality of things--it is the circumference towards which man must reach. Man must be like the peacock, eyed all over (Jerusalem 98). The self is to be destroyed by an expan- sion, not by shrinking. Man becomes all not by generalizing him- self, but by particularizing himself. The woman figure mirrors the state of the ego: the narrower the ego, the more destructive is her power; the greater the ego, the more creative her power. The ego and the unconscious are in- separable. When man is still-born, when his imagination ceases to expand, ceases to find or fulfil itself, he moves from the state of Orc, the unactualized potential, to the state of Urizen, the im- potent potential. Thus, he fails to be born out of the egg-womb of space, the dome-skull of time: Instead of dying into life, he lives into death. In this state, the female is dominant-- ""Dragon red & hidden Harlot"". In the state of Los--the ""Vehicular"" imagination--the female is viewed as being unifiable or identifiable with the male. Here she takes her place as an extension of the imagination rather than a restriction upon it. One critic has said that Jerusalem is a condensed version of the Divine Comedy, Paradise Lost, and Paradise Regained. Any one of Blake\'s Chree major poems contains subject matter for any one of Eliot\'s ""three districts"". The Four Zoas, Milton, and Jerusalem are Blake\'s Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso respectively. As whole poems they can be identified with Orc, Milton, and Jesus-- the first two are sons of Los, --the last is the Divine Body who is the imagination and who is of ""the likeness & similitude of Los"" (Jerusalem 96) The power of Satan, the Reasoning Power, is defeated by the dominant spirit of each poem in different ways. Orc, as energy and desire, expends himself; Milton, as poetic inspiration and apocal yptic vision, reveals reality; Jesus, as fulfilled energy Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Through extensive considerations of the ""Orc figure"", the ""woman figure"", and the figure of the ""prophet-poet"" and a great many images and symbols prominent in Blake\'s work (such, for instance, as the figure of ""Hand"") the thesis shows something about \'Mental Forms Creating"" (Milton 33) and the ""stubborn structure of the Language"" (Jerusalem 40). It is most concerned to discover the ""iconography"" of Blake\'s imagination-- the images and symbols which fulfil his thought those particular things which imagination has transformed into the ""divine body"" of poetry. Among the many images and symbols of the creative theme ex- amined in this thesis are, the four Zoas (Los, Urizen, Tharmas, and Luvah), Orc, Rintrah, Palamabron, Satan, Merlin, Reuben, Judah, Milton, Leutha, Oothoon, Ololon, Vala, Rahab, Jerusalem, Hand, the ""open centre"", ""Divine Analogy"". ""Canaan"", ""Fourfold Vision"" the circle, the square, the ""scarlet robe"" the furnace, the forge, the ""white dot"", the spectre, and the emanation. The nature of Blake!s allegory and the relation between the poetry and the poet\'s engraved designs are also discussed. BIOGRAPHY 1924 - Born, New York City, N. Y. 1950 - A.B.

First, it was shown that electrical stimulation of the dorsolateral hippocampus oould reinforce a T-maze discrimination directly by serving as a reward when no conventional reward (such as food) was present. Secondly, the application of hippocampal (HPC) stimulation in a Tearning paradigm which included a conventional reinforcer had different effects depending on the I type of learning and the timing of HPC stimulation. (a) When 0.5 sec of HPC stimulation followed each lever press along with a food pellet in a Skinner box (contingently stimulated group), there were no significant differences in rate of acquisition of lever pressing compared with a randomly stimulated group and an implanted but unstimulated group. However, a retention test conducted 24 hr after any stimulation and with no food or stimulation present Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

These results are con- sistent with reports that HPC stimulation disrupts long-term memory without affecting immediate memory. The HPC stimulation was subsequently shown tor be rewarding in self-stimulation tests. (b) In one- trial passive avoidance learning, HPC stimulation significantly improved memory whether it was self- administered or administered by the experimenter shortly after the single conditioning trial. Thirdly, the effect of diazepam (Valium) a drug which suppresses HPC activity, was investigated in direct HPC reinforcement (self-stimulation) and in passive avoidance learning. If stimulation of the HPC is rewarding and if associations are established and reinforced through HPC activity, thén disruption of HPC function should suppress both self-stimulation and long-term memory formation. (a) Diazepam (1 and 2 mg/kg) significantly and drastically suppressed HPC self-stimulation; a lower dose (0.5 mg/kg) of diazepam had very smal effects. That diazepam did not merely depress motor performange is indicated by the increase in self-stimulation seen with preoptic Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

(b) Diazepam (5 mg/kg)alsc produced anterograde amnesia in one- trial passive avpidance learning compared with a vehicle solution (propylene glycol + ethanol) when injected 30 .min before the trial. The disruption of learning produced by diazepam did not appear to be state-dependent or due to diminished sensitivity to footshock. Taken together, the results suggest that the activity of the hippocampus is important in rein- forcement; that is, in establishing the neural representation of associations between stimuli and responses.

S. Foster, Supervisor: J. W: Hunt ABSTRACT Ultrasound is the basis of a varied and rapidly expanding group of medical diagnostic procedures. Although the breast is well situated and contains no structures that obstruct the propagation of ultrasound, this organ has proved to be one of the most difficult to adequately image. Investigation in this field has recently been stimulated by reports indicating that a significant decrease in mortality due to breast cancer could be achieved using a safe effective screening procedure. While mammography is an effective means of detecting small breast tumours, many critics feel that its use would result in as many new breast cancers as were détected, in the screening-program. For this reason the use of ultrasound is a particularly appealing alternative. A number of groups have demonstrated the capability of ultrasound in breast. imaging but several problems remain to be solved before it can be used in routine clinica. imaging or as a screening tool. Two of the most fundamental problems are addressed in this thesis. The first concerns the improvement of lateral resolution throughout the image and the second relates to the development of a comfortable and effective clinical scanning procedure. The lateral resolution. is directly related to the focussing of the ultrasound beam. The physics of ultrasound focussing in breast and other human tissues is examined using a unique variable aperture, variable focal length transducer. Focussing is tested as a function of lens f-number (focal length/diameter), tissue type and thickness. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 2. The causes of defocussing are investigated and the crucial role of ultrasound attenuation and system bandwidth are discussed. A frequency of 3.5-4.0 MHz and an f-number of 2:003.0 are recommended for breast imaging. The use of low f-number lenses results in \'a reduction of the region in which the image remains sharp (depth of field) . One way to solve this problem is to divide the image rangé into ,a number of well focussed ""zones"", each scanned separately, and summed to generate the final image. An instrument called the Demonstration Scanner is used to asse\'s the validity of this approach. Significant resolution gains are demonstrated and a rule for selecting zone width is derived. A new concept in ultrasound image formation, called the Cylindrical Transducer Scatter Scanner, has, been invented. With it, the depth of field problem is attacked directly by replacing the traditional point focus with a line focus generated by a cylindrical) transducer. Right-angle scatter, detected by a transducer aimed along the axis of the cylinder, is used to generate the image. This approach achieves an extremely sharp focus, with a depth of field essentially equal to the length of the cylinder. The ultrasonic field of the cylindrical transducer is examined experimentally and theoretically. Preliminary images of simple phantoms and in vitro tissue samples are exceptionally encouraging and a program for the development of scatter imaging technology is described. Breast II is a simple ultrasound breast scanner designed for clinical use. Emphasis is placed on the development of a comfortable and acceptable scanning procedure, not on resolution. The \'rationale behind this design is discussed. Clinical résults indicate that a simple linear scanning regime is sufficient to provide high .quality images of normal and pathological tissues.

Siddique WORK AND FAMILY IN A CONTEMPORARY URBAN-INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY: AN ANALYSIS OF CANADIAN DATA' This dissertation examines the articulation between work and family systems in a sample of urban families who live in a highly industrialized city of Canada. Empirically, the problem investigated deals with an ahalysis of the degree of differentiation and jointness in family activities in relation to the work experience of wage-earners. The existing research on work and family has not succeeded in providing a clear conception of the linkages between different aspects of work and family systems. The findings accumulated by other studies that have tended to seek explanations of differentiation by concentrating on the socio-êcohomio status (SES) of the family and its network connectedness, are only of limäted value. Our critical analysis of this literature reveal's meagre support for the SES hypothesis and an inconclusive picture of the network hypothesis . We, developed a tentative theoretical model in which we con- ceptualized differentiation and jointness as modes of adaption. These modes indicate two of the several possible ways by which the family adapts or adjusts its internal' and external activities to the exigencies of the world of work. With, respect to family, we identified four subtypes of family activities: two of these, family tasks and decisions, relate to internal activities of the family, and the other two, primary- level activity and organization-focussed activity, to its domain of external activities. In regard to the work system, we con- centrated on the following three structural components: work setting, content of work, and work career. Operationally, we Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The three components of work were lirked with four aspects of family activities. This generated 12 theoretical hypotheses. Briefly stated, we expected that the families of wage-earners who work in bureaucratic organizations, and those who hold less socially complex jobs, and those whose careers have been less orderly would be more likely to adapt to a differentiated mode of participation in each aspect of internal and external family activities. These hypotheses were tested with data on 105 intact, single- earner families where either husbard or wife worked as a primary wage-earner. This sub-sample was derived from a larger sample of 211 East York families who participated in The Family Dynamics Study All 12 hypotheses were substantiated by the empirical evidence. The observed patterns of family activiti/es were largely invariant among families having different levels of network involvements and were only moderately affected by their SES. Further examination of the data generated findings which were opposite to the network hypothesis. We interpreted these findings as indicative of greater strength for our explanation of family differentiations than the one offered by SES and networkistudies. The findings of this research have implications of particular relevance to the study of work and family in contemporary urban- industrial societies. They make, it clear that the social experience of industrial workers. is not segmental as some earlier writers have Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

And unlike much of the current theorizing in stratification research, these findings indicate that work can no longer be considered an invididual activity. To increase involvement in family life that may allow a greater jointness, the need for certain fundamental alterations in the work system seems apparent. This implies that the modern developments of industrialization must be subordinated to socio-political policies sensitive to the existence of dual linkages between work and family worlds. In future research there is a need for shifting the conventional focus from SES and networks to micro studies of work-family linkages. Special attention must be given to a specification of the process by which work and family systems afrect each other. For a better understanding of the reciprocal effects of work and family, future research must recognize the importance of developing more dynamic and interactional models.

The resulting amplitudes for the ""physical"" states have the following interesting promerties: 1) they resolve- the problem of ""missing"" resonances: many states have very small relastic couplings 2) the states predicted to be strongly coupled to elastic channels correspond to observed resonances in both their masses and partial widths, and 3) the observed violations of SU (6) sélection rules are also correctly predicted.

ABSTRACT Various synthetic procedures were designed for selectively trans- forming carbohydrate polymers into versatile products with a wide range of applications using as substrates several abundant and industrially important polysaccharides (alginate, cellulose, chitin, chitosan, guaran, locust bean gum, xanthan gum). Thus, alkyl amide, amine, ester, and hydrazine derivatives of alginic acid as well as similar derivatives of cellulose and xanthan gum were prepared. Selective modification of chitosan afforded N-aryl derivatives which were found to be highly efficient metal-chelating agents. Attachment of carbo- hydrate moieties to the amino groups of chitosan using reductive alkyla- tion yielded a new class of branched, comb-like, 1-deoxyglucit-l-y1 derivatives which exhibited a great diversity of useful properties in terms of solubility, gel-formation, compatibility, and interaction with other polysaccharides: The synthetic principles of this procedure were found to be amenable for adaption to other polysaccharide systems and branching types, as exemplified by a guaran derivative with chain- extended trisaccharide branches. Reductive alkylation of chitosan using ferrocenylaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride produced a new type of organometallic polysaccharide derivative. Combined enzymic and chemical modifications were found to be high-yielding for guaran and locust bean gum: specific oxidations using galactose oxidase afforded versatile C6' aldehyde intermediates which were reductively aminated to produce a wide variety of useful derivatives including ii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

One group of subjects received the tasks as outlined by Elkind (Group I) while another group of subjects received modified versions of the tasks (Group II). Each conservation task was presented at two levels of transformation; moderate and extreme. In addition transitivity of solid continuous quantity was examined in relationship to conservation. The sample consisted of 144 subjects; 48 Kindergarten, Grade one and Grade two students. Half of the subjects within each grade level were assigned to Group I, the other half was assigned to Group II. Within each group half of the children were male and half were female. An analysis of variance performed on the conservation tasks indicated that identity and equivalence conservation were of equal difficulty. The main effects of Group and Age vere significant and the interaction of Sex x Grade was significapt. The criterion factor of judgment only vs. judgment plus explanation was found to have a significant effect, with more trials passed with a judgment only criterion. Data were scored according to two different procedures; one procedure required that subjects be consistent in their answers in each phase of the tgak in order to receive non-zero scores. This procedure employed a three-point scale with values of 0, 1, and 2. The other procedure used a scale with values ranging from 0 to 6 inclusive. Subjects were given a point for each of the six questions answered correctly in the conservation tasks, regardless of the consistency of the ansvers. The method with the 0, 1, and 2 scale showed that identity and equivalence 111 conservation were equally difficult, while the method which employed the 0-6 scale showed that identity was easier than equivalence. It was shown that the latter method yielded these results because of an artifact in the questions asked. Furthermore it was shown that scale scores which resulted from an application of the 0-6 scale were an ambiguous reflection of the level of concept attainment. An analysis of variance was performed on the transitivity tasks. The main effects for Group and Age were significant. The transitivity tasks were significantly easier than all conservation tasks at all grade levels. The implications of this and the co-occurrence of identity and equivalence conservation were discussed in relation to Elkind's (1967) analysis. mac Wellins 1""]"

Ethnographic data intro- duce the social environment and provide the context for an analysis of socializing experienees. The analysis of socialization. also gives insights into social change and adaptive responses, and focuses on the acquisition of ethnic identity within a multicultural setting. The thesis seeks to show how children, youths and adults resolve personal dilemmas of formulating ,an identity when the sanc- tions of socializationoprocesses are in opposition. The study points out that any, individual may be involved in first, second and third & processes of socialization which may be experienced simultaneously or in sequence. The context in which they foccur is a complex one bounded by membership in a specific extended family. The individual must also accommodate the demands of opposing family groups who form the Band corporate structure and the demands of the adjacent white society in which he/must also be involved. Primary emphasis is placed on the description and analysis of the process of socialization rather than on the practices. This provides an extension to the traditional lit- erature on socialization and a fuller understanding of the dynamics of interaction between adults and children as well as. among those adults who undergo the third process of socialization. Findings indi- cate that cultural conflicts, if they exist, do not necessarily result its ii in perceptdal conflicts. Rather, one individual may \'choose a pri- \'mary path which avoids conflicting choices; another may tolerate ex- posure to conflicting processes and emerge ""as a bicultural person. In either case, the individual is Squamish, by self-definition. The ineffective socialization that is carried out by parents who were themselves unable to complete a socialization process in either white or Squamish culture is also discussed. This ""discussion links historical determinants of life styles with the re-establishment of a closed system for socialization within the extended farily. Such a closure restores to the grandparental generation their roles as. pri- mary socializers and cultural custodians. It also allows some youths to choose to become bicultural. The copeluding statement of the thesis links the presenta- tion of Squamish theories of socialization and the observed practices with specific theoretical concerns about devélopment, identity, and cognitive balance which have a general application.

Only two tin films, 910 A and 3250 A in thickness deposited at room temperature on sapphire rods, were examined. All the measurements were made in the temperature region o < AT50.4°K where D. T = Te- - T. o The critical current measurements on a 585 A thick indium film are the first measurements ever made by combining the use of a compensated geometry and fast rising current pulses. The current pulses used had a K rise time of 7 nano seconds. The measurements were made by using Tetronix 661 sampling oscilloscope having a rise time of 0.35 nano seconds. The temperature dependence of the critical currents in the region or AT<0.15""k is in complete agreement with G - L theory. For a number of indium films, the critical currents were measured by using pulses having a rise time of 1.2 micro seconds. The critical currents have been found to vary linearly with the film thickness, in agreement with G - L theory. Measurements with fast pulses seem to indicate the existence of a transition delay of 6 nano seconds, independent of current amplitudes. The transition from the superconducting to the normal state, immediately following the transition delay, appears to be extremely fast. Analysis of ii the thermal rise in the resistance after the transition, seems to give a qualitative evidence for the existence of thermal propagation mechanism suggested by Bremer and Newhouse. For the critical field data, the temperature dependence is in accordance with G - L theory in the range o< D T < 0.3° K for both indium and tin films. The effective penetration depth calculated in the manner of Ittner, and Douglass and Blumberg was found to be dependent on thickness and mean free path. The critical magnetic fields were found to be inversly proportional to the film thickness in agreement with G - L theory. IB Brown J. B. Brown']"

Smith A mathematical model has been developed to describe the growth of trees in stands of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) from age ten to age 100 years. An initial square pattern of spacing was assumed At age ten years the trees were assumed to be open-grown, that is, growing in diameter at breast height at a maximum rate. A regression of d. b. h. on age was obtained from eighteen open-grown, Douglas fir trees measured on the Saanich Penin- sula, Vancouver Island. The relationship derived from these data agreed with further data collectéd elsewhere in the coastal regions of British Columbia and Washington and in the interior of British Columbia. The d. b. h. growth of individual trees was predicted by five-year periods. Relationships between crown width and d. b. h. were calculated from data on 426 open-grown, Douglas fir trees. There was a close correlation between crown width and root spread for open-grown trees. A multiple regression equation was obtained for height of 869 trees on d. b. h. and basal area per acre. All regression equations calculated for use in the model were highly signi- ficant statistically. The model is initiated with a matrix of 15 x 15 trees (or tree ""locations""). The initial d. b. h. of each tree is specified and, from the crown width/d. b. h. regres- sions, the crown width of each tree is calculated.

This was because it was found that, in young Douglas fir plantations, there could be considerable overlapping of the crowns before d. b. h. growth was reduced. As soon as competition sets in the original 40 per cent reduction is systematically reduced The proportion of the circumference of each tree that is occupied by the crowns of surrounding competitors is then calculated. This proportion indicates the amount of competi- tion to which the tree is being subjected and varies between zero, if the tree is open-grown, and one or more, if the tree is completely enclosed by the surrounding competitors. The five-year d. b. h. growth of each tree is then deter- mined from the d. b. h./age regression described above. D. b. h. increment is reduced in value by the proportion of the crown occupied by competitors. If the reduction is sufficiently great, continued survival of the tree is con- sidered unlikely, and the tree is assumed to have died. The periodic d. b. h. growth of the surviving trees is calculated at five-year intervals to age 100 years. All calculations are performed using an I. B. M. 7090 electronic computer. A summary of the structure of the stand can be printed out at the end of each five-year period if required. Height growth can be described by modifying the stand model by including an appropriate regression equation.

The mathematical model developed here satisfactorily describes the growth of Douglas fir stands on an individual tree basis, over a wide range of site conditions, stand densities, amounts and distributions of mortality and thinning regimes. Field data cannot be secured to evaluate the accuracy of all the tests made. However there are no gross errors in absolute values and results are accurate propor- tionately. The model described here can aid the forester in managing Douglas fir stands in the Pacific Northwest. By simulating the growth of his stands from age ten to age 100 years in a few minutes he can study questions that would otherwise require several human generations to evaluate.

Murdoch ABSTRACT The primary objective of this thesis is to present a unified account of the various generalizations of the concept of ring of quotients given by K. Asano (1949), R. E. Johnson (1951), Y. Utumi (1956), G. D. Findlay and J. Lambek (1958). A secondary objective is to investigate how far the commutative localization can be carried over to the noncommutative case. We begin with a formulation of the notion of D-system of r ight ideals of a ring R. The investigation of the D-systems was moti- vated by the fact that each maximal right quotient ring of R consists precisely of semi R-homomorphisms into R with domains in a specific D-system of r ight ideals of R or of R¹, the ring obtained from R by adjoining identity. A nonempty family x of right ideals of R is called a D-system provided the following three conditions hold: D1. Every right ideal of R containing some member of x is in X. D2. For any two right ideals A and B of R belonging to x, o-1B belongs to X for each R-homomorphism Q of A into R. D3. If A belongs to x and if for each a in A there exists Ba in x, then the ideal sum of aBa (a in A) is in X. Each D-system x of right ideals of R induces a modular closure operation on the lattice L(M) of all submodules of an R-module M and hence gives rise to a set Lx(M) of closed submodules of M. We are able to set up an isomorphism between the lattice of all modular closure operations on L(R) and the lattice of all D- systems of right ideals of R and characterize the D-systems x iii used in Asano's, Johnson's and Utumi's constructions of quotient rings in terms of properties of Lx(R). In view of the intimate relation between the rings of quotients of a ring R and the extensions of R-modules, we generalize the concepts of injective R-module, rational and essential extensions of an R-module corresponding to a D-system Y of right ideals of R1. The existence and uniqueness of the maximal Y-essential extension, minimal Y-injective extension and maximal Y-rational extension of an R-module and their mutual relations are established. Finally, we come to the actual constructions of various exten- sions of rings and modules. The discussions center around the centralizer of a ring over a module, the maximal essential and rational extensions and the different types of rings of right quotients. We include here also a partial, though not satisfac- tory, solution of the noncommutative localization problem. D.C Andrich nj Currently""]"

In the presence of essentially static and uniform magnetic bias fields (produced by Helmholtz coils) it was found that the oscillations are suppressed by a flip instability of the plasmoid and the direction of flip is controlled by the transverse magnetic field. Using the suppression of radial hydromagnetic oscillation as the criterion for flip, it is found experimentally that BT 1f apt is greater than a critical value, then the plasma ring flips. 'BT' is the strength of the bias field perpendicular to the axis of the theta coil, 'a' the radius of the discharge vessel and 'p' is the gas pressure. The experimental results are interpreted in terms of a snowplough model for the discharge, in which the plasma current forms two concentric cylinders. The predictions of the theory agree with the experimental observations. F.: lanzer Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.""]"

This work also illustrates that the transannular cyclization reaction previously developed in our laboratories is of great versatility in the synthesis of alkaloids in the Vinca and Aspidosperma families.

These compounds were transformed via their mesylate derivatives to the quaternary salts (95 or 187) which served as the crucial intermediates for the preparation of the nine-membered ring alkaloids.

That the UNIX kernel was selected for study is largely due to the impact that the facilities supported by and supplied with the operating system have made on teaching institutions and, more recently, industry. However, the approach that is taken need not be limited to UNIX and may be applicable to other operating systems. The synchronized message passing commands of CSP adequately encapsulate the issuing and servicing of requests in a distributed kernel. Preemptive commands are proposed for CSP reflecting the need for management of peripheral devices and process priority within operating systems. We define operational semantics for CSP including commands for exceptions and interruptions. The contribution that extended CSP makes to potentially real-time applications is examined and a scheme is given for the implementation of synchronized message passing in the presence of preemption. For the partitioning of the kernel, we establish a suitable division of labour through the examination of a standard Version 7 UNIX system. The anticipated message passing throughput is considered in relation to commercially available hardware for a very local network providing very fast, reliable, variable Length message transfers. An approach to implementation of the distributed kernel is presented which considers the residence of system tables and the use of existing source code. A more precise notion of the processes involved in the distribution is presented by a model in CSP. This model shows, at a functional level, the interactions of processes in the network. The distributed model relies on the semantics of CSP and in particular uses Language extensions for managing priority and preemption. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

My approach here is different from my predecessors not only in that I end my arguments by the mid-eighteenth century but also in that I attempt to illuminate the development of Earth science in seventeenth-century England as an integral part of the Scientific Revolution. Standard textbooks on the Scientific Revolution have discussed the development of physics, chemistry and biology, but not Earth science. This thesis discusses an aspect of the Scientific Revolution which has not previously been fully recognized. In the early seventeenth century the study of the Earth was not a distinctive discipline, but the formation of the Royal Society of London later in the century provided a forum where different approaches to the Earth could come into contact. The Society\'s plan for natural history facilitated the introduction of each programme, and eventually, by the mid-eighteenth century, created a basis for geology. I suggest here that the ""internal"" development of Earth science was conditioned by ""external"" factors such as the formation Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

I challenge the internalist historian\'s conviction that the ""internal"" development of science is autonomous and absolute. I even claim that the large-scale pursuit of Earth science was stimulated and motivated by ""cultural values"". Unlike the externalists, however, I do not intend to show any relation between the science and the value- orientation of a society as a whole, because such an approach does not explain why conflicts at various levels occurred within a scientific community and eventually created a basis for geology. Therefore, this thesis is an attempt to synthesize the ""internal"" and ""external"" approaches to the history of science. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

ABSTRACT By a philological analysis of garden imagery in a wide cross section of mainly thirteenth century French texts, various types of gardens make their appearance: the Hermit\'s Garden, the Monastery Garden, the Castle Garden and, most elusive of all, the Garden of Love. Each of these when examined in the light of literary interpretation and historical documentation illustrates part of the complex pattern of the artistry of medieval garden design. More importantly they cast light on the ambivalent attitude towards nature that is variously viewed in an erotic or Christian context. The garden, nature perfected by man, could be assumed to be principally a place of delight, an example of the ""locus amoenus"". Instead, as texts are examined, it becomes clear that this is only partly true. Although such a ""topos"" may be the basis of later description, medieval authors used garden allegory to express the tensions inherent within the human condition. Gardens were both idealized and described as a reality of everyday life. The former shows the yearning of man for the perfect, the latter illustrates clearly the complexities of individual and social life. The garden of the thirteenth century truly reflects a specific age and environment. More generally it mirrors eternal human conditions or problems. The aspirations of man are shown but also his situation when confronted with the day to day realities of hope, fear, love and other emotions and the specific problems of his time such as brigandry and social unrest. All in all the garden in medieval literature provides an apparently accurate ""thermometer"" of man in relation to his immediate environment and to God and conversely is used by authors as an image, metaphor or allegory for man himself']"

University of Melbourne June 1984 THE FORMATION OF THE MUSIC CRITICISM OF HECTOR BERLIOZ (1823-1837) ABSTRACT This thesis aims to trace the beginnings of Berlioz\'s career as a music critic and the reasons behind his becoming a critic. In the title of the thesis I use the word ""formation"". I could alternatively have talked of ""the early music criticism of Hector Berlioz"" as no formation in terms of growth or development can really be traced in the early reviews. Berlioz is bold, self-assured, and opinionated from his first article, and his prose style consistently shows remarkable fluency and ease. The word ""formation"", however, applies more to the consolidation of Berlioz\'s position as a professional critic, from his first letters to the editor of 1823 to full-time criticism written concurreutly for numerous papers from 1834 onwards. I have chosen to stop at 1837. This is the year that Berlioz edited the Revue et Gazette Musicale, which is an indication of the extent to which he had become established as a journalist and critic. The thesis falls into two parts. In the first part I study Berlioz\'s activity as a critic within the general context of music criticism at the time. I have studied the music criticism of a number of critics contemporary with Berlioz in political as well as literary papers in order to try to arrive at an understanding of the scope and limitations of the music criticism of the time. I have examined Berlioz\'s relationship to each of the journals to which he contributed and the ways the critical malpractices of the day affected his criticism. The second half of the thesis looks more directly at Berlioz\'s criticism and specifically at his criticism of his contemporary composers. The majority of Berlioz\'s reviews of this period are of the Opéra, Opéra-Comique, and instrumental concerts, mainly the Conservatoire concerts. This reflects not so much Berlioz\'s tastes as those of the Parisian public and the editors of the various journals to which he contributed. These reviews form the basis of the study of Berlioz\'s views about his contemporaries. A major issue that emerges from the study of these early reviews is Berlioz\'s ceaseless struggle between diplomacy and honesty. Yet the most enduring impression one has of Berlioz is that of an idealist whose love of music was so passionate and governed his life to such an extent that even the treadmill of daily criticism could not dull its ardour.

228,,"gear, john anthony",ph.d.,mechanics,wave propagation in density stratified fluids,university of melbourne (australia),1984,"['ABSTRACT This thesis falls into three distinct sections. In chapter one the fundamental properties of internal gravity waves are investigated, with respect to the effect that the basic physical quantities of fluid velocity, and buoyancy frequency, have upon the propagation of these waves. Among others things, it is shown that when the wavenumber tends to infinity the wave phase speeds are then found to depend only upon the local behavior of the mean flow near an overall maximum or minimum of the velocity profile. Also, the phase speed and group velocity are plotted against wavenumber, when the fluid velocity has a hyperbolic tangent and a hyperbolic secant profile. Several interesting phenomena are observed in these plots. In shallow stratified fluids internal solitary waves are described, to first order in wave amplitude, by the Korteweg-de Vries equation; the solution for a single solitary wave has the familiar ""sech2""-profile and a phase speed which varies linearly with wave amplitude. In chapter two this theory is extended to second order in wave amplitude. The second order correction to the wave profile and the phase speed and the first order correction to the wavelength are all determined. Four special cases are considered in detail. It is shown that in certain special circumstances the first order theory may fail due to the vanishing of the nonlinear coefficient in the Korteweg-de Vries equation. When this occurs it is shown that a different theory is required which leads to an equation with both quadratic and cubic nonlinearities. In chapter three the strong interaction between weakly nonlinear long internal gravity wave modes is studied. Strong interactions occur when the wave phase speeds are nearly equal although the waves belong to different modes. In shallow stratified fluids it is shown that this (I) Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

It is shown that these coupled equations possess three conserved quantities as well as an exact analytical solution involving the characteristic ""sech2 -profile of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Also it is shown that when the coefficients satisfy some special conditions, the coupled equations possess an n-soliton solution in terms of the Korteweg-de Vries n-soliton solution. In general though the coupled equations are found not to be amenable to solution by inverse scattering technique, and thus a numerical method has been employed in order to solve the equations.

The subjects were twenty-eight children attending two groups in a preschool centre (sessional kindergarten), eighteen female and ten male. The ages ranged from three years four months to four years eight months at the commencement of the study. The children were studied for one year at their kindergarten. Five problem areas were explored (1) moral reasoning; (2) behaviour in peer con- flict interactions; (3) relationship between moral reasoning in response to hypothetical dilemmas and behaviour in real-life con- flicts; (4) construction of an instrument to describe and measure early moral reasoning and behaviour; (5) moral education within a preschool setting. Semi-structured interviews using Kohlberg-type dilemmas, and naturalistic observations of spontan- eous social interactions in free play situations, were the methods used. Pretest and post-test interviews and observations were six months apart. Teachers of one group of children participated in a moral education project which included a pro- cess for using naturally-occurring peer conflict in the kinder- garten to facilitate moral development.

The two styles suggested by review of the literature are breadth of interest curiosity, an orientation towards seeking varied and changing experience, and, depth of interest curiosity, an orientation towards investigating new ideas, events and puzzling phenomena. The explanations of curiosity behaviour which have been proposed by ""optimal arousal"" and ""cognitive"" theorists are evaluated and compared with the explanatory system for complex human motivations offered in ""differential emotions theory"". It is suggested that differential emotions theory with its emphasis on the role of affective-cognitive structures offers important insights into the processes operating when curiosity is aroused.

The relationships between scores on the Two Factor Curiosity Scale and responses to an occupational interest inventory were explored to determine the construct validity of the scale. In addition, the nature of the two curiosity styles as affective-cognitive structures was investigated through an examination of the pattern of basic emotions reported in situations representing both breadth and depth of interest curiosity. Important similarities and differences were found in the patterns of basic emotions associated with each curiosity style.

The work of this part closely follows the lines of the corresponding classical development of set theory by Anthony Morse, highlights several classical definitions and results which are inadequate for a proper description of constructive mathematics, and develops constructive replacements for these where possible; of particular importance is the constructive proof of a general recursion theorem, from which the familiar theorems of simple and primitive recursion readily follow. The second part of the thesis (Chapters 2 - 5) is concerned with various problems of constructive analysis, the link between these problems being their involvement with compactness or local compactness at some stage. Chapter 2 serves as an introduction to this analysis, and includes the definition of metric injectiveness and the proof of a constructive substitute for the classical result that a continuous injection of a compact Hausdorff space onto a Hausdorff space has continuous inverse. In Chapter 3 we give an improved definition of one-point compactification of a locally compact space, and then develop the theory of existence and essential uniqueness of such compactifica- tions of a given space. In turn, this is applied in Chapter 4, which deals in full with the space of continuous, complex-valued functions which vanish at infinity on a locally compact space, and with star homomorphisms between such spaces; interpolated within the main body of this chapter is the vital Backward Uniform Continu- ity Theorem, which leads to a discussion of possible constructive substitutes for the classical Uniform Continuity Theorem. The final chapter deals with constructive substitutes for various topologies associated with spaces of bounded linear mappings between normed linear spaces. The main results of this chapter concern the weak operator topology on the space Hom(H,H) of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space H, and include a constructive proof of the weak operator precompactness of the unit ball of Hom(H,,H), and a proof that the compactness of this ball is an essentially non-constructive proposition. The chapter ends with a discussion of linear functionals and the weak operator topology on Hom (H,H), and a partial substitute for the classical characterisa- of ultraweakly continuous linear functionals on a linear subset of Hom (H ,H) In addition, there are five appendices, three of which develop material arising from that in the main body of the thesis. In the first of these three, we describe an axiomatic theory of proofs within the formal system of Chapter 1, and derive (amongst other results) a very satisfactory characterisation of proofs of 'p -> a'; the second deals with connectedness, and builds up to a constructive proof that a closed ball in finite dimensional Banach space is connected; finally, the last makes a remark on metric injectiveness in the light of a conjecture in Chapter 2.""]"
236,,"giaretta, david leslie",ph.d.,astronomy,instabilities in interstellar space,university of oxford (united kingdom),1977,"[""1. ABSTRACT This thesis is a partial investigation of instabilities in the interstellar gas which are driven by a coupling between the ambient radiationfield and the gas, and which do not arise when this coupling is missed out. The modes of couplings considered are, firstly, the attenuation of the radiation with the concommitant effects on the temperature, density and composition of the gas, in various combinations. Secondly, velocity dependent effects are examined in various circumstances and thirdly, radiation pressure, not included in the other two, is looked at in the simple case in which temperature and compositional changes are excluded. The explanation of why these instabilities may be of interest, and an outline of the extent to which similar instabilities have been investigated, is given in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 gives details of the basic equations used in the case in which the absorption line shape is ignored. Many of the equations are used in the other chapters. The equations are linearised in perturbations of the density, temperature, radiation field and composition, and the resulting dispersion relationship is found for a harmonic perturbation. Because of the attenuation term in the radiative transfer equation, the poly- nomial has complex coefficients. In Chapter 3 we investigate the properties of the roots of a complex polynomial by an extension of Routh's methods, and derive a set of criteria to determine the number of roots which have positive real part. These roots correspond to exponentially growing 2. perturbations, or, in other words, they correspond to instabilities. Later in the chapter we apply these methods to Field's dispersion relationship for thermal instabilities and derive many of his conclusions in a fairly simple way. By a slight extension the method yields estimates of the growth times of the instabilities. Some related situations are also examined in a similar way. After the detour of Chapter 3, Chapter 4 gives details of some models of the heating and cooling of the interstellar gas as well as of the reactions to be considered, namely the formation and destruction of H2 and of carbon ions. Some of the limitations of the models are also discussed and the roots of the dispersion relation are given for different values of the parameters. New instabilities do appear; for H2 their timescales of growth are rather too long to be of interest; for carbon 'no short timescale instabilities are discovered. Chapter 5 gives similar details for a system of pure hydrogen gas which may be of interest in studies of the formation of the first generation of stars. In Chapter 6 there is a criticism of an earlier work by Schatzman on a similar subject, in which it is shown that his analysis was wrong. Chapter 7 deals with a new possibility, namely that, as the gas moves, photons will be seen to be shifted in frequency and so the molecules will be exposed to a new set of destructive photons at frequencies which have not been selectively absorbed in the unperturbed gas. First the simplest case, that in which the temperature is unperturbed, is treated analytically. The attenuation of the radiation field is not considered. The effectiveness of this doppler-induced effect depends upon both the absorption profile 3. and the radiation spectrum; these factors as well as temperature perturbations are included next. Both line absorption and continuum absorption are considered. The former is used to investigate the stability of the interstellar gas and of pure hydrogen gas, where hydrogen molecules are dissociated by line absorption; the latter is used in connection with HII regions and also the interstellar gas where the photodissociated species are hydrogen atoms and neutral carbon respectively. Radiation pressure was not included in the previous chapters but in Chapter 8 a modified version of Field's theory of instabilities driven by radiation pressure is presented. The new feature is that the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient is included in the equations and this, in the case of a flat radiation spectrum, leads to an exact cancellation of the dominant term in Field's equation. Several restrictive features of Field's conclusions are thus modified and seem to make this instability rather more useful in the study of instabilities in the interstellar gas than it appeared in Field's work.""]"

It is shown that the six isomers may be divided into two groups of three, 2, 5-, 2, 4- and 3, 5-dimethylpyridine and 2, 6-, 2, ,3-, and 3, 4-dimethyloyridine. Within each group, photolysis of one isomer leads to the formation of the other two isomers as major products. The rearrangement is shown to be intramolecular and a mechanism is proposed in which the nitrogen atom effectively inserts itself between any two carbon atoms in the aromatic nucleus.

This work concerns itself with the exact study of the dynamical properties of two model systems. After a brief summary of theory and concepts previous work is discussed, and this provides the motivation for the formulation of the first model. This quantum mechanical lattice model and some of its equilibrium properties are described in Chapter II. The dynamical problem to be studied is formulated in Chapter III; this is essentially the study of the time evolution (generated by the Hamil- tonian) of a finite system at temperature T1 coupled to an infinite copy of itself at a temperature T2 and acting as a heat bath for the system. The problem is solved for the special case, when the coupling as scaled by the parameter Y, takes the value Y = 1. The general case for arbitrary Y values is treated in Chapter IV. It is shown that the system approaches the equilibrium state of the heat bath in a non-exponential manner, provided the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is continuous and does not have a discrete part. This result is in complete accord with the findings of other work summarised in Chapter I. The mixing properties of the model and behaviour of the relaxation rate in the weak coupling limit are studied in Chapter V. The model is shown to fail to behave as a calorimeter and in view of this result the relevance of the concept of mixing to irreversible behaviour is discussed. The main conclusions and results for the model are summarised at the end of Chapter V. The second model discussed, was first introduced by R.J Glquber to study the dynamics of the Ising chain. The main feature here is that the time evolution is defined through a Master equation, and the associated stochastic operator. It is shown in Chapter VI that exploiting fully the free fermion character of the stochastic operator for the Glquber model, it is possible to provide a simple method to the study of the dynamics of the Ising Chain.']"

The thesis deals with three problems coming under the heading of probabilistic geometry. They are dealt with in three chapters. The first chapter is concerned with the angles formed by triples of independent, identically distributed points on a plane. The work is part of an investigation carried out by several workers and motivated by an archaeological problem concerning supposed collinearities formed by ancient sites. In the symmetric Gaussian case the joint distribution is found of two of the angles of the triangle. An integral is given for the density of a named angle in the case of a general Gaussian parent distribution. The asymptotic probability that the triangle has one very obtuse angle is discussed together with the changes that it undergoes when the parent distribution is ""stretched"". Finally bounds are obtained for this asymptotic probability when the parent distribution is one of a family of circularly symmetric distributions. The second chapter is about the way in which Brownian motion knots in 3-space. A new concept, that of a ""knot-tube"", is required because the self-intersecting character of Brownian motion in 3-space means the usual topological notion of a knot can not be applied. It is known that Brownian motion in 5-space and above has very simple topological behaviour, but the 4-space case is unsettled. A partial result is given for 4-space. The final chapter considers the topological behaviour of contours of two generalisations of Brownian motion to multidimensional time. The two generalisations are the Brownian sheet and the generalisation due to Levy. Boundedness of the contours of the Lévy process is shown but no analogous result is known for the Brownian sheet. In both cases it is shown that almost surely the union of all non-trivial contours has zero measure. For topological reasons this union cannot be empty.']"

This work has investigated a simple model for uniform rectangular dot arrays. From this model the reflection coefficents of the dots and the correct angle for the array's reflectors can be deduced. Experimental results for these parameters are reported for some specific types of metal dot array using aluminium dots on Y-cut lithium niobate. Several different arrangements of dots within the arrays have been investigated, and their different advantages and disadvantages are contrasted. The use of specific array patterns to suppress undesired reflection modes has been investigated, and it has been shown that such suppresion can be achieved by this means. Some information has been gathered on the reflection properties of different shapes of metal dots and with different thicknesses of metal. The properties of these different dot types have been compared and their implications on a theory for the behaviour of reflective metal dots have been discussed. Experimental results have been obtained for the reflection of surface waves on YZ lithium niobate by thin metal strips at normal incidence. These results have been shown to agree with the available theoretical models for the problem. The effect of the mutual capacity of the strips on their behaviour has been shown to be important if several of them are grouped together. This part of the work is seen as a preliminary to the possible development of a model for the reflection properties of metal dots. Two inline reflective dot array devices have been made. The results reported show that the principle of these devices has been sucessful, but that more work is still needed if they are to fulfil their full promise.""]"
241,,"cheel, vanessa",ph.d.,optics,diffraction properties of deformed copper single crystals,university of oxford (united kingdom),1980,"['Abstract This dissertation concerns the diffraction properties of deformed copper single crystals with emphasis on their behaviour as neutron monochromators. It presents an examination of the effect of crystal imperfection on the disbraction of gamma and neutron radiation, using transmission electron microscopy to determine the detailed defect structure. The basic diffraction equations for transmission geometry are studied as a function of wavelength and thickness for neutrons and Y-rays, and qualitative agreement between experimental and theoretical parameters is obtained. However the theoretical approach is dependent on an idealised defect structure, having a Gaussian distribution of lattice misorientations, which is rarely found in deformed copper single crystals. A relatively simple relationship between r-ray and neutron rocking curves is only applicable to uniform defect distributions. The wavelength dependence of neutron absorption for the range 0.5 to 5. 08 is established theoretically for various neutron monochromator materials and experimentally for copper. The temperature dependence of this behaviour is also considered. The r-ray dibbraction is extremely sensitive to variations in the defect structure with position in the crystal, and this sensitivity is found to be dependent on both the dislocation density and the large- scale arrangement of dislocation structures. The dependence of the rocking curve width on the crystallographic direction of incidence could be reproduced qualitatively from a model in which bands of heavily deformed crystal are assumed to delineate regions of relatively perfect crystal. In order to determine defect densities and arrangements from difbraction data x-ray theories were applied, but these also require a uniform microstructure, which was not found in the crystals examined. This is due to the neutron monochromator requirement of a large deformed single crystal. All crystals were deformed in compression, either as flat plates or as large rectangular blocks from which plates were cut.']"
242,,"walker, alison bridget",ph.d.,condensed matter physics,studies of disorder in fastionics and of a nuclear quadrupole interaction in ordered markets,university of oxford (united kingdom),1980,"[""ABSTRACT This thesis consists of two completely separate parts. In Part I, we look at disorder in fastionic conductors, and in Part II we examine the pseudoquadrupole effect in ordered magnets. Part I looks at two aspects of the disordered state in fastionics, where the disorder is due to ions moving off their regular sites to positions close to other regular sites, a feature especially characteristic of the fluorites. The first aspect is how Coulomb interactions could be responsible for the co-operative behaviour of defects which causes the transition to fastionic behaviour. We look at this with a model of charged defects on a lattice, applying techniques involving classical diagrammatic perturbation theory to find the free energy of our model system. Using elementary thermodynamics, we show how this model can predict co-operative behaviour. The second aspect is the nature of the disorder above the fastionic transition. We look at disorder in lead fluoride using a molecular dynamics simulation with an interionic potential that we obtained. We use the simulation to examine the distribution of anions in both real space and k space. Simulations have been made on the other fluorites CaF2 and SrC12 and it is possible that the high dielectric constant of lead fluoride might lead to qualitatively diff- erent behaviour. Our results show that this is not the case and we find defect concentrations similar to those obtained from CaF2 and SrC12. Our k space analysis however gives defect concentrations an order of magnitude larger, in approximate agreement with experiment. In Part II we set up a theory for the pseudoquadrupole effect in cubic ferromagnets and show that it is related to the difference in longitudinal and transverse magnetic susceptibilities. Model calculations are performed for a Heisenberg ferromagnet using molecular field theory near the critical temperature Tc, and spin wave theory at low temperatures; and the itinerant model at absolute zero and Tc. We find that the pseudoquadrupole effect in iron and nickel and at impurities in these metals appears to be very much less than measured quadrupole effects. We also look at the effect in GdA12 and show that it can not explain a temperature dependent quadrupole interaction seen experimentally We therefore conclude that the observed quadrupole effects are due to real electric field gradients. 'You should understand, therefore, that there are two ways of fighting: by law or by force. The first way is natural to men and the second to beasts. But as the first way often proves inadequate one must needs have recourse to the second. So a prince must understand how to make a nice use of the beast and the man. The ancient writers taught princes about this by an allegory, when they described how Achilles and many other princes of the ancient world were sent to be brought up by Chiron, the centaur, so that he might train them his way. All the allegory means in making the teacher half beast and half man, is that a prince must know how to act according to the nature of both, and that he cannot survive otherwise.

During the period 1954-60 the VWP was enveloped in a continuing debate over how to achieve national unification. In 1954, despite disagreement within the VWP\'s Central Committee, it was decided to accept a negotiated settlement to the war. Accordingly the Party set out a two-year policy of political struggle synchronized with the various provisions of the Geneva Agreements. The VWP saw its tasks in each zone as being fundamentally different: priority was given to socialist construction in the north, while cadres in the south were expected to carry out a people\'s national democratic revolution. Implementation of this new policy in the south was hampered by the growing strength of the Diem government, and by the failure of VWP diplomacy to secure either French or Russian commitment to general elections. The failure to hold consultations in July 1955 led to growing southern disenchantment. In September 1955 the Fatherland Front was created. Its program in effect recognized the need for a policy of political struggle based on something other than the Geneva Agreements. This policy proved difficult to implement. Although alliances of convenience were forged with the armed forces of the dissident sects, the Diem regime proved successful in meeting and overcoming this challenge. By late 1956 southern pressures for increased use of revolutionary violence coincided with failures in conducting land reform in the north. These Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The immediate result was the drafting of another long-range policy. Political struggle was given renewed emphasis but a limited policy of ""extermination of traitors"" was permitted. The prime task was to rebuild the Party organization. This policy was carried out during 1957-58 at which time great efforts were made to consolidate the north and to win international sympathy and support. In 1959 the southern lobby argued convincingly for a new policy sanctioning reunification ""by all appropriate means"". This meant the use of armed forces. This new policy of combining political and armed struggle was ratified at the VWP\'s 3rd National Congress in September 1960. The growing influence of the southerners was evident in leadership appointments to the Politburo, Secretariat and Central Committee. Le Duan, the outspoken advocate for armed struggle, became the Party\'s First Secretary. The 3rd National Congress committed the entire VWP to carrying out the people\'s national democratic revolution in the south. Southern cadres set about creating a national united front and regroupees in the north began returning south. In December 1960 an organizing committee met and proclaimed the formation of the NFLSVN. Over a year later, after much organizational work, the First Congress of the NFLSVN was held. The origins of this Front lie both in the interaction between contending factions within the VWP leadership and the interaction between the VWP and various southern social forces and personalities on the one hand, and the Diem regime and its American backers on the other.

250,,"johnson, ian",ph.d.,archaeology,the getting of data: a case study from the recent industries of australia,the australian national university (australia),1980,"['Abstract Two obstacles stand in the way of satisfactory synthesis of Australian prehistory at more than a very general level. In the first place, excavation techniques have grown up piecemeal and have failed to come to grips with the difficult conditions posed by the undifferentiated sandy stratigraphies and low sedimentation rates typical of many Australian sites. In the second place, the piecemeal genesis of excavation techniques is reflected in the lack of established channels for the exchange of excavation data and in incompatibility between the information recorded by different workers. The first part of this thesis examines the prehistory of the Blue Mountains area, starting with a general review and leading to a more detailed study of the Noola and Capertee 3 sites. The study of these two sites suggests that the model of a site as a chronologically continuous sample may not be applicable even to sites with rich assemblages and that horizontal patterning is an important feature which must be taken into account when designing site sampling strategies. New dating of Capertee Site 3 confirms that backed implements appear in the site at about 3000BP. Following on from the Capertee 3 dating, a critical review of the literature relating to the appearance of backed implements and of other traits associated with the Australian Small Tool Tradition demonstrates that no dates older than about 5000BP have yet been substantiated for Small Tool Tradition assemblages. However it has not proved possible to tie the dating down accurately owing to the lack of data and imprecision of associations between dated samples and artefact assemblages. The concluding chapters are aimed at resolving some of the problems identified in the preceding discussion. Attention is focussed on methods of data recording, since standardisation of this aspect of excavation not only helps establish a framework for excavation onto which individual strategies can be grafted, but represents a first step in the direction of greater comparability between data collected by different workers. The discussion is completed by the documentation of a computerised system for the recording and analysis of excavation data. The use of such a system facilitates the analysis of the material and also generates a catalogue which can be duplicated for storage with the collection. It is suggested that future developments should be aimed at standardisation of basic classificatory and attribute systems in order to promote comparability between collections and thus provide a better information base for the synthesis of Australian prehistory.

The assumption that a bass-line instrument always is needed in 17 th- century basso continuo mostly results from questionable interpretations of theoretical sources, The dissertation explores when and why such in- struments were used in Italian music of this period. The use ofabass-line instruments vary greatly from one musical genre to another. Within some genres its presence was required in some pieces and not in others. Most sacred vocal music is accompanied by the organ continuo alone. An extra bass part, doubling the b.c. is sometimes included in large scale works after 1660. In the church sonata a bass-line instrument was used when the bass contained important contrapuntal material. In either case there would be a separate part for the bass-line instrument. In opera a bass-line instrument is used continuously, also in the recitatives. Most often the b.c. would be performed by three instruments: harpsichord, cello, and archlute, the reason probably being that more instruments were needed in the larger halls where opera customarily i Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

C. usually was performed either by a bass-line instrument alone, or by a chordal instrument alone. Since the three part texture is harmonically complete either alternative makes good sense. A case can be made for doubling the b. c. in chamber sonatas and secular cantatas from after 1675 whether or not a separate part for this purpose existed. The chamber sonata was influenced by the church sonata and adopted contrapuntal procedures characteristic of the latter. Thereby the bass often came to contain important material, and in such cases it would seem appropriate to use a bass-line instrument even when a part is not furnished. Secular songs up to ca. 1675 are acc rapanied by a chordal instrument alone. Developments in opera at this time influences the performance of cantatas. In opera arias, the bass, which earlier had been devoid of melodic interest, now became melodically independent, much like an obbligato part. Opera composers apparently took advantage of the presence of a cello and used it in a soloistic capacity. When similar arias appear in cantatas, a cello, at times, was included there as well, although clearly not as a geniral practice. The bass-line instruments most commonly used were the violone (Italian bass gamba, tuned GG - C - F - A -- d - g ), the archlute, and the cello. The North European bass gamba ( = Italian tenor gamba, tuned ii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. D - G - - C - e - a - d') was rarely used except for special effects, and then mostly in opera. When the participation of a bass-line - instrument was desired in 17 th-century Italian music there would normally be a separate instrumental part for this purpose. In the absence of a separate part, a bass-line instrument may be included in chamber sonatas and secular cantatas from ca. 1675 onwards if the bass is of sufficient contrapuntal importance. Modern notions, and editorial practices, which assume that the b. c. always should be doubled are in error. No general practice of bass-line doubling existed and each individual work therefore has to be considered separately on the basis of usage in that particular musical genre. , iii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

THE ROLE OF FORETGN CONTRIBUTIONS IN PREWAR JAPANESE CAPITAL FORMATION - WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE PERIOD 1904-14. ABSTRACT Bernard Key The purpose of this dissertation is essentially twofold: 1. to fill the empirical void which has persisted in Balance of Payments work for Japan and 2. to offer, based on this empirical work, an analysis of a long glossed over factor in Japan's economic development: the role of foreign capital in the financing of Japanese capital formation. The results of my empirical work appear in the Statistical Appendicies, where I have attempted to provide for the first time annual, current account (including invisibles as well as merchandise trade) data for Japan over the entire prewar period presented throughout according to the International Monetary Fund format. While this Balance of Payments data could be used for a variety of purposes, I have chosen to focus here on one aspect of these accounts: the estimation of the flow of capital across Japan's international frontier. Based on this Balance of Payments data, I have been able to obtain via the indirect estimation method comprchensive annual estimates for capital flows, heretofore unavailable, for the entire prewar period. Couchied in this newly derived empirical framework, the three analytical chapters presented here aim, respectively, at reexamining the ii. following issues relating to the role of foreign capital in prewar Japanese capital formation: First, the long pattern and investment implications of our capital flow estimates; Second, the impact of foreign capital inflow on private investment during the period where the connection between capital inflow and domestic investment seems strongest, namely, the years between the Russo-Japanese War and World War I (1904-14) i and Third, the broader perspective of capital flow within the framework of the investment spurt. In Chapter I, The Pattern of Capital Movements : Long Term Investment Implications, an analysis of the more aggregate first question is presented centered about the capital flow periodization based on level and trend movements in Ip/GDCF. We then seek to explore the investment implications of this capital flow periodization by a comparison with the Ohkawa-Rosovsky real side, investment spurt periodization, by an analysis of the cyclical or contra cyclical relationship between the gold flows and the trade balance, and, finally, by an examination of the long torm or short term nature of the capital flows. Taken together, this macro data suggests the need to focus on the period 1904-14, the only time when capital inflow appears strongly connected to domestic capital formation. Having singled out the 1904-14 period for its strong investment implications, we will next want to investigate the capital inflow--domestic investment relationship in greater detail. To this end, Chapter II, Capital Inflow in the Second Spurt, 1904-13: The Transfer Mechanism, represents a more disaggregate attempt to relate capital inflow and private investment. Here we first challenge the traditional notion that capital \\ inflow was related to a balance of trade deficit, generated in large part 1 iii. by military imports. Instead, we suggest that the capital inflow of this period can best be linked to the expanding investment of the private sector. To substantiate this connection we offer an explanation of the transfer mechanism from the Rest of the World to the Japanese Central Government via a treatment of movements in gold and specie held abroad. We then examine the Japanese Central Government to Private Sector transfer through a money flow analysis of the relevant economic categories over this period. Finding that there was a large net financial transfer to the Private Sector from the Japanese. Central Government following the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War, we then conclude by tracing the impact of this transfer by offering two examples at the firm level. In Chapter III, Toward a Broader Perspective: Capital Flow and the Investment Spurt, we try to place our financial side, capital flow pattern in broader perspective by a comparison with the Ohkawa-Rosovsky real-side, investment spurt periodization. Comparing the two we are able to suggest that the large foreign capital inflow of 1904-13 is the key link from their first, concurrent growth investment spurt to their second, differential structure investment spurt.""]"

A locally convex space E will be called p-reflexive (resp. p-complete) provided the evaluation map from E to (E I ) - is a topological linear isomorphism (resp. , bijection), where the dual space in each case has the topology of precompact convergence. Note that quasi- complete spaces are p-complete, and that barrelled, quasi- complete spaces are p-reflexive. Let D denote the cat- egory of p-reflexive spaces and continuous linear maps. It is shown that D is complete (i.e. limits exist in D), cocomplete (i.e. colimits exist in D1, and self- dual (i.e. D is equivalent to its dual category) (cf. 3.5 and 4.9). Let Sets denote the category of sets and functions; let Sop denote the opposite or dual category of D; and let hom: Dop x D Sets denote the functor such that if A, B € ob D, then hom(A,B) equals the set of all 0-morphisms from A to B. Let V: D Sets denote the forgetful functor. In this situation, we have Theorem (cf. 3.1 and 17.11). There exist functors Hom : DOP X D D and D: D X D D such that (1) V o Hom = hom ; and (2) for all A, B, C € ob D, Hom (AOB,C) is naturally isomorphic to Hom (A, Hom (B, C) ) .

Recall that a k-space is a Hausdorff topological space with the property that a subset is closed if its intersection with each compact subset is closed. Let J denote the category of k-spaces and continuous maps; let Jop denote its opposite or dual category; and let C: Jop X D Sets denote the functor such that if X € ob I and E E obD, then C (X,E) equals the set of all continuous functions from X to E.

Let a: I x J J denote the product functor. Theorem (cf. 23.9 and 23.12) . (1) If x, Y € obJ , then M (x=Y) is naturally isomorphic to M(X)(MM(Y) ; and (2) if X has cardinality one, then M (X) is isomorphic to the scalar field. This last theorem contains the basic ingredients need- ed to prove that M can be extended to be a ""strong"", symmetric, monoidal functor (cf. 23.18). From this, it follows that M will transform any algebraic structure that might occur at the level of J to an analogous al- gebraic structure at the level of D. Thus we have Theorem (cf. 24.24 and 25.10) . Let or and B be cate- gories such that either (a) 01 = k-spaces and B = D- coalgebras; (b) or = k-monoids and B = N-bialgebras; or (c) or = k-groups and B = S-Hopf algebras. Then M can be regarded as a functor from or to B. Furthermore there exists a functor R : B or such that if G € obol and H € ob B. then Moro or is naturally isomorphic to Mor (M(G),H) .

Finally, I would like to mention a result only peri- pherally related to the preceding. A p-reflexive space E will be called a dF space if there exists a Frechet space H such that E is D -isomorphic - to H\', where H\' has the topology of precompact convergence. The con- cept of dF space enables me to prove a generalization of the Banach-Dieudonne theorem. Theorem (cf. 8.6). Let E be a metrizable locally con- vex space and F be a dF space. Then the topology of precompact convergence is the finest topology on hom (E,F) which gives to each equicontinuous, pointwise precompact subset of hom (E,F) the same relative topology as the topology of pointwise convergence.

Field work was focused on faunal survey and the analysis of patterns of coexistence. A simple ecological classification for ants is presented that is based on the field work done. Such ecological features as temporal activity pattern, foraging site selection, and degree of foraging cooperation among the ants studied seem to represent an integrated pattern of resistance to or avoidance of predation by vertebrates. Experimental data are presented in support of this suggested pattern of relationship. Ant faunal survey collections were made at four sites spanning a 2,000 m elevational range in California and at four analagous sites in Chile. The Chilean survey was broadened to include ants of the entire country. Resource division patterns were detailed at a 1,000 m site in each country, with data being gathered from baits, mapped quadrats, nest observations, and direct field observations. Major components of resource division among ants at these sites are habitat selection, foraging strategy, and temperature or time-of-day preferenda. Most species apparently overlap broadly in food taken. Resource exploitation patterns at the two sites were noted to be similar, but a large component of the similarity is a result of taxonomic similarity of ants at the two sites, notably in species of common, widespread iv Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Patterns of ant - habitat association along a 2,000 m elevational gradient are similar in the two regions. A major difference between ant communities in the two regions is the three- fold greater number of species in the California sites. The low number of species in Chile probably reflects both the influence of biogeographic isolation and low species packing. Low species packing in Chile may be attributable to low between-year predict- ability of rainfall. California species may be more closely packed than those of Chile in association with greater amplitude of daily and within-year temperature fluctuation (with a predictable pattern) than in Chile. Consequences of high species packing are greater difference among similar habitats in both number of species and species composition of the community. This study indicates that both consequences are expressed in California but not in Chile. Approved RKCbell August 28,1973 V Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Children who showed greater relative interest in interacting with objects than people (i.e., higher object orientation) were expected to have developed intellectual abilities regarding understanding and organizing physical materials. In contrast, children who showed greater relative interest in interacting with people than objects (i.e., higher people orientation) were expected to have developed intellec- tual abilities regarding social knowledge. Hunt's concept of intrin- sic motivation provided a description of the possible mechanisms involved in the development of these specific intellectual abilities. Children's environmental orientation was expected to be influenced by their parents' attitudes. Thirty-eight white middle-class subjects (mean age = 4; 10) were observed during their nursery-school free-play period.

The children were then given six tests assessing aspects of social knowledge (e.g., know- ledge of sex-role norms, role-taking ability, moral judgment) and I four tests assessing ability to organize and classify physical materials. Scores for each type of test were summed to form two summary test scores. In addition, ratings were made of the general quality of social behavior (e.g., peer-leadership, forcefulness) and a socio- metric index of peer-popularity was obtained. Finally, a question- naire was administered to parents assessing expectations for auto- nomy and outgoing socialness and preferences for sociability over self-reliance. Children who spent relatively more time in play with objects than people were found (as expected) to perform better on tests of ability to organize and classify physical materials. Children who spent relatively more time in play with people than objects, however, did not perform better on tests of social knowledge. Instead, higher scores on these social tests were related to higher ratings on the quality of social functioning and to greater popularity among peers. Thus, scores on the social tests related to quality, rather than quantity, of social interactions. The social behavior of children differing in orientation was also examined. The most striking difference was that children who show- ed greater relative interest in objects engaged in considerably fewer interactions with peers (as would be expected) but more interactions Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Further analysis showed that the greater adult directed- ness of these children did not account for their interest in objects nor for their higher scores on tests of ability with physical materials. No important sex-differences were found; however, birth-order effects were found for several variables. The most important was that first-born and only children showed greater relative interest in people compared to later-born children. Only a chance number of relationships was found between paren- tal attitudes and children's behavior. A tentative conceptual model was presented to account for rela- tionships among intellectual abilities, orientation, and other aspects of social behavior. According to this model, interest in the inanimate environment interacts with knowledge of physical objects in a dyna- mic manner, growth in one leading to growth in the other. That is, differentiated concepts of the physical world lead to interest in envir- onmental events that deviate somewhat from these concepts; attention to these deviations leads in turn to still greater differention of con- cepts. In a similar manner, quality of social behavior may interact with extent of social knowledge. That is, well-developed concepts of the social world presumably assist children in forming satisfying relationships with others; conversely, more positive feedback from other people is likely to provide a more favorable climate for social learning.

Analytic theory complemented by computer simulation is presented describing the nonlinear mode coupling of laser light with small and large amplitude, resonantly excited electron plasma waves. Trapping of electrons in the electron plasma wave is found to be an important nonlinear feature.

The recovery time following a discharge is defined and a set of reference recovery times is experimentally determined with which other recovery time data is compared. The reference recovery times are obtained by using copper on steel and graphite on steel electrode combinations. The copper and the graphite are used as both the anode and as the cathode for each particular elec- trode combination. The effect of contamination on the refer- ence recovery data is included. Possible explanations of the shape of the reference recovery time curve are also given. Different types of graphite materials are used to obtain recovery time graphs for comparison with the reference data and possible reasons for the differences that occur are given. The steel electrode is replaced with other metallic materials to determine their affect on the recovery times when compared to the reference recovery time. The effect that the EDM dielectric fluid has on the recovery times is investigated and discussed. The damaging gap conditions termed 'coking', which is the growth of carbon type stalactite and stalagmite formation on the opposing electrode surface, and 'burring' which is the apparent occurrence of consecutive discharges in the same spot, are investigated and their relationship to the recovery time information is discussed. The effect of the gap polarity, electrode materials, and EDM fluid on these detrimental condi- - tions is investigated and discussed. Possible mechanisms for the coking phenomena are mentioned. A favorable comparison of the recovery time data and actual EDM machine results is made and a comparison with experienced minimum 'off' time graphic results is also made. i""]"

Construct a model by considering the ordinary random walk on a finite chain, and assume the existence of a finite strength repulsive inter- action for any pair of steps (links) between the same two lattice points. This can be introduced by a weighting factor u=exp(-V) where V is the strength of the interaction. The total number of walks, Cp (u); the total number of walks returning to the starting n point, Up (u): the mean-square end-to-end distance, <<< (u)) i and the weighted sum of mean-square deviation of steps (links), <=2' n are all calculated to the --th order in one dimension where n=20 for calculating Cn n for caluclating Un(u) 2' and < r (u) > . In the case of small values of n, use the extra- n polation techniques and establish the asymptotic behaviors of these C n n B H , r 2 (u)> = A (u) (u) and t as . The indices n are calculated for different values of V and the results are given a.s: a (u) = 0 for all V>0; 0<u<1 -1/2 for V=0; u=1 B (u) = 1 for V>0 0<u<1 1 for V=0; u=1 = 2 for V>0; 0<u<1 The probability distribution of the point 2 on a long chain of n-th order walks, Z (e,u), is also studied. The maximum n peak of the distribution shifts to the end of the chain due to the increase of the interaction V. The generating function method is employed to calculate those quantities Cn (u), Un (u), <r n 2 (u)) and Z n (l,u) in the case of strong coupling in which the interaction, V, is large. The asymp- totic behaviors as for the quantities are obtained either by evaluating the residues with respect to the singularities of the generating functions or by applying the saddle-point contour integration. When the results are compared, they turn out to be the same. Last, the Green's function method based on Edwards' suggestion was tried as a solution to this problem.

Thermal models of the workpieces for the abrasive cut-off operation and for horizontal spindle grinding are developed. The workpiece temperatures are measured in grinding tests with thermocouples inserted into the workpiece. The calculated and the exper imental temperatures are compared and a small number of parameters is determi ned in such a way that the best possible fit between both temperatures is obtained. One of the parameters so evaluated is the fraction of the total grinding energy which appears in the workpiece in the form of heat energy. This is an important parameter in studying the chip formation process in grinding. The cooling ability of the grinding fluid used in the tests is another important result which can be evaluated using this procedure. The model of the workpiece for surface grinding is then used to investigate the effect of the table speed on the workpiece tem- peratures. in the conventional range of speed the temperatures are found to increase with decreasing table speed. However, if the table speed is reduced by a factor of about 100, the tem- perature begins to decrease again due to more effective cooling. There exists a range of small table speeds for which the workpiece temperatures are lower than at conventional table speeds. xx Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Both axisymetric and non- axisymmetric disturbances were considered. The downstroam propagation of the disturbance, that has a constant frequency and is imposed at a specified location in the fluid, is governed by four, coupled, linear, ordinary differential equations in terms of its velocity components. and hydrodynamic pressure. The flow is considered to be convectively stable if the disturbance decays in the downstream direction. For a wide range of Reynolds numbers, frequencies, and azimuthal mode numbers, the coupled differential equations were solved numerically for the complex eigenvalues, or wave numbers, each of which defines a mode of propagation. A series solution for small values of the pipe radius followed by step-by-step integration to the pipe wall was employed. In order to ascertain the number of eigenvalues within a closed region, an eigenvalue search technique was developed. The theoretica! results predict the pipe Poiseuille flow to be stable to all Linfinitesimal, ax!symmetric and non-axisymmetric disturbances up to Reynolds numbers of 10,000. xiii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The subjects of this dissertation are: 1) the early development of a municipal organization responsible for public health in the city of Pittsburgh and 2) the changing environmental conditions of the city of Pittsburgh which led directly to increased governmental responsibilities for public health. Municipal Organization for Public Health in Pitts- burgh, 1851-1895 describes the general public health issues of the nineteenth century, how and why Pittsburghers organ- ized to promote community health, the public health conditions in Pittsburgh, the institutions that evolved, the medical advances which caused changes in public health policies and the extension of community responsibility for public health. A forty-five year period was selected for investiga- tion, 1851-1895. In 1851 the Pittsburgh city councils estab- lished a Board of Health. The Board was reorganized in 1868, 1872 and again in 1888 when it was succeeded by the Bureau of Health, a subdivision of the Department of Public Safety.

It was possible to trace the evolution of the idea that the community should be responsible for aspects of health which are beyond the control of citizens acting individually. The findings of this study are that the development of a municipal organization for public health in Pittsburgh coin- cided with an expanding economy and rapid population growth. The pressures created by the new urban environment led to the need for increased delegation of community responsibility in the health area. When environmental conditions and epidemics of disease in Pittsburgh could no longer be satis- factorily dealt with on an individual basis, the municipality assumed responsibility, albeit limited responsibility, in these matters. Inadequate last minute responses to health problems characterize the activities of the Board of Health, with a pattern of action taken only in response to a crisis such as an epidemic of disease. The need for improved ad- ministrative efficiency to cope with epidemics of disease led to the few innovative changes at the Board of Health, i.e. collection of vital statistics, published reports, employment of a corps of workers and the reorganization of the Board of Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The spread of disease was facilitated by rapid urbanization and industrialization. A discrepancy existed between those diseases people feared most and those which caused the greatest amounts of sickness and death in Pitts- burgh. Finally, a new concept in public health practice, prevention of disease, occurred in 1895 with the use of bac- teriological science. Because of the low priority given to health, as evidenced by the lack of funds allocated for this purpose, inattention to health questions by the governing body, and a minimal amount of pressure from citizens for better health conditions, and because of lack of knowledge of how best to combat disease, the public health officials could not keep pace with deterioration of the urban environment and the ac- companying high rates of disease that occurred in Pittsburgh in the second half of the nineteenth century.

An elastic stability approach was taken with results showing only a slight reduction in the buckling loads due to curvature. A deflection amplification approach indicated that even though this is true, the growth of lateral deflection is gradual starting from the beginning of loading and has a significant effect on the initial yield load of the girder. A simple model was devised for exhibiting this gradual build up of deflections and stresses and includes an approximation to the cross sectional deformation which has been observed in tests. This simple model was used to determine the initial yield and ultimate strength loads of curved girders and to determine the forces developed in the lateral braces due to lateral bending and cross sectional deformation at these loads. Design formulas and recommendations were developed for compact and non compact girders and for composite members. Re- quirements for bracing forces are included for these cases.

281,,"reusch, charles frederick",ph.d.,chemical engineering,selective membrane transport,carnegie mellon university,1972,"['ABSTRACT This dissertation includes experimental and theoretical work on membrane diffusion transport in the presence of a carrier. The carrier reacts reversibly with the diffusing molecule or ion and enhances or facilitates the flux. Experiments were conducted to determine the transport of various monovalent and divalent ions across an organic liquid membrane consisting of cyclic polyether dibenzo-18- crown-6 dissolved in chloroform. The experiments proved that diffusion in the low dielectric constant chloroform takes place by ion pairs rather than by ions. They also confirm the existing theory that fluxes are a linear function of carrier concentration. Ions react selectively with dibenzo-18-crown-6. The experiments proved that the fluxes of various ions are dependent upon this selective reaction. The most important variable appears to be the ratio of the ion radius to the polyether central ring radius. The evidence suggests that if two ions are different in size in solution, a. separation of the two ions can be effected by diffusion. Theoretical work extended the theory in the literature to include different values of the diffusion coefficient for each of the species present and to include the existence of an electrical potential. One analysis shows that when ions diffuse across the membrane as ion pairs, the flux depends on the squares of the individual ion concentrations on each side of the membrane. This result was confirmed by the experiments. When two salts are present in high concentration and diffusing against each other, the electrical potential does not attain high values. When only one salt is present in high concentration, the potential attains high values. The direction of the field is such that the cation flux is retarded and the anion flux is enhanced; this result is expected since it is the cation flux which is enhanced by the presence of the carrier. The analytical solutions obtained in the theory are consistent with the zero current condition. selective Membrane Transport by Charles F. Reusch - Dept. of Chemical Eng.

In the multiple modular design problem, parts are to be grouped into several modules; these modules are in turn used to fulfill the requirements of sev- eral different applications. If we restrict ourselves to the production of a single module, the problem will be called the modular design problem. In both cases, the solution to the problem will be integer. The word continuous will be used to imply that the integer constraints have been forsaken. The first chapter of the thesis is a general introduction of the topic. This chapter includes some history of standardization, an outline of the problem and an indication of previous work done in the area. Chapters two and three develop the basic model, discuss the application, and indicateheuristio procedures for solving portions of the problem. Chapter two was coauthored with David Rutenberg. In this chapter we discuss the general multiple modular design problem. Chapter three develops a model which aids in allocating slight product variations (made possible by modular design) to several markets. Chapters four and five were coauthored with Gerald Thompson. These chapters are theoretical in nature--they discuss the continuous modular (chapter four) and multiple modular (chapter five) design problems. In chapter four an efficient algorithm is given for attaining the solution to the single module case. Chapter five ex- tends the results of four to the more general multiple module case. In this problem there exist many local optima; a heuristic search procedure is outlined which can be used to locate a ""good"" local solution. Chapter six discusses an algorithm which would solve the modular design problem (for the integer solution). In this procedure, the solution to the continuous problem is very helpful. The algorithm is expected to be able to solve moderate size problems--stopping the algorithm before completion should yield good solutions to larger problems. Slight modifications of this algorithm could be used to achieve integer solutions to the multiple modular problem. Given the continuous solution to the multiple modular design problem from chapter five, good solutions to the integer problem could be achieved heuristically. PRODUCT DESIGN: SUBASSEMBLIES FOR MULTIPLE MARKETS David P. Rutenberg and Timothy L. Shaftel Abstract A corporation may profit by installing more parts than its products require. Each product or application requires a specified number of parts such as inductors, resistors and capacitors. For assembly and maintenance reasons, parts are grouped into subassembly modules. If there are economies of scale in manufacturing subassembly modules, it may be worthwhile to standardize on a few module designs that will be used in all products or appli- cations even though a few more parts than needed are installed. The cost of giving away extra parts by using few standard modules must be balanced against the fixed costs of producing more types of standard modules. In the multi-market problem there is a fixed cost with the production of a module, and then another fixed cost when the module is used in a market. The paper presents a solution procedure and the time results of computer runs for the problem of finding the best standard modules for a multi-product, multi-market corporation.']"

Design consider- ations and construction parameters of the instrument are given in detail. For reaction with oxygen atoms the second order rate constant at room temperature is 1.1 x 10-15 cm³/molecule sec (standard deviation 0.3 x 10-15), invariant over the pressure range 0.75 - 5.0 torr. In the presence of molecular oxygen the stoichiometric factor is 1.2, increasing to 5.5 oxygen atoms consumed per dicyanoacetylene molecule in the absence of molecular oxygen. Initial attack is at the acetylenic bond, and stable end products are co, NO, CO2 and C2N2. CN, OC3N, OC2N and C2N are observed as important intermediates, and the presence of the intermediate C2° is inferred. First mass spectrometric evidence of the species OC2N2 has been obtained. The reaction between active nitrogen and dicyanoacetylene was studied over the pressure range 0.7 - 8.0 torr and from room temper- ature up to 200°C. The reaction bears great similarity to the equally complex reaction of active nitrogen with acetylene, which supports the hypothesis that the site of initial N-atom attack is on an acetylenic rather than a terminal carbon. Three distinct reaction zones are identified, the slow region, the flame region, and the post-flame region.

The flame zone, characterized by intense CN emission, is a chain recombination of N atoms mediated by CN and NCN radicals and initiated by small quantities of C4N2.

They were limited, however, by practical considerations regarding the size of the systems that could be dealt with, the type of analysis that could be performed, the synthesis algorithms etc. These limitations existed mainly because of the low level (gates) of components used as building blocks in the designs being constructed. A feature lacking in existing CAD systems is the exploitation of alternative design implementations derived from an initial behavioral specification. The approach in this thesis is to start with a representation of the desired system in terms of behavioral specifications at the Register Transfer (RT) level, and produce alternative structural specifications at the RT level, in this case, in terms of modular components, the Register Transfer Modules (RTM) set (DEC PDP-16). The behavioral description of the system to be designed is compiled into an internal representation (a graph model). A set of routines test and perform transformations on the graph, thus producing alternative control flow structures. These are parameterized according to cost and speed requirements and hence define a design space. Heuristic techniques are used to reduce the design space search process and the number of alternative solutions by implementing only worthwhile transformations, according to goals specified by the user as part of the input.

The same standard value could be assigned to the d exponent for C, N, o and F and, similarly, a single p exponent for hydrogen in all hydrides. Two polarization basis sets, with the standard polarization exponents, were thus developed : 6-31G* containing d functions on the first row atom, and 6-31G** which additionally has p functions on hydrogen. Consideration of the energies of reactions as the basis sets were systematically improved has enabled the tentative prediction of (i) hydrogenation energy errors at the Hartree-Fock limit, and (ii) the magnitudes of correlation energies of double and triple bonds compared to that of a single bond. The study of the conformations of simple carbocations has shown that polarization functions are important in non-classical structures involving three-center bonds. Finally, investigation of the geometries of hydrides has revealed that polarization functions are essential for proper calculation of bond angles. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

We present a formal model of the process concept, and then we use this model to compare four different synchronization primitives. We are able to prove that there are differences between these synchronization primitives. Although we compare only four synchronization primitives, our general methods can be used to compare other synchronization primitives. Moreover, in our definitions of these synchronization primitives, we explicitly allow conditional branches. In addition, our model separates the notion of process from the notion of scheduler. This separation allows us to unravel the controversy between Hansen and Courtois, Heymans, Parnas. This separation also allows us to define formally the release mechanism of the PV synchronization primitive. ""On Synchronization Primitive Systems"" by Richard J.

As the first step in implementing the elasto- plastic procedure, an advanced elastic implementation is developed. This advanced implementation is shown to offer substantial improve- ment in numerical accuracy over previous elastic implementations. A method for incorporating the effects of material non-linearity into the boundary-integral technique is then developed and implemented, and several sample problems are presented which illustrate both the applicability of the implementation and some of its limitations. Both implementations are evaluated with regard to their degree of realization of the potential advantages of the boundary-integral technique through application to real engineering problems. The elastic implementation represents a second generation implementation of an approach which has been available in the literature for several years. Therefore, as should be expected, this implementation is highly efficient and possesses to a large extent all of the potential advantages of the boundary-integral technique. On the other hand, the elasto-plastic boundary-integral solution technique represents the very first attempt at implementation of this approach for elasto- plastic problems. While the results are not as convincing as those for the second generation elastic implementation, they are encouraging. An Implementation of the Boundary-Integral Technioue for Planar Problems of Elasticity and Elasto-Plasticity by Peter C. Riccardella - Dept. of Mechanical Engineering Carnegie-Mellon University ii The boundary-integral technique offers the potential to be a very powerful, general purpose tool for the solution of linear and non-linear problems in the area of solid mechanics. As greater computational capability becomes available, the advantages of the boundary-integral technique should become even more consequential since the technique inherently tends to increase the portion of problem solving effort performed by the computer and to decrease the effort required of the analyst. iii']"

Its primary goal is the isolation of a set of primitives which lead to a concise description and correspondingly concise implementation of program optimizations. In addition to being powerful enough to provide a concise representation, the primitives are also basic enough to apply to a wide range of languages and optimization techniques. The concept of similarity functions is introduced. A set of new optimizations described in terms of the similarity notion is proposed. A translator is described which implements code motion, redundant expression elimination, and new similarity-induced optimizations using the primitives developed in the dissertation. Examples are presented demonstrating the effect of these optimizations. ii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.']"

Van wyk, Ph.D. University of Pittsburch, 1971 After illustrating the practice of Christian ethicel writers of inferring that men ought to do something on the gounds of some belief about the chorecter, commands, or purgose of God, this disser- tation thon reisos the fundamentsl question with which it deals, that ic, whether, in the licht of Hume\'s observations about the impossibility of inferring an \'ought\' from en \'is\', theological beliefs can lecitimately be consiciered to be relevent to basic moral convictions. After consid- ering some other attemots to overcome the *is\'-\'ought\' dichotomy (those of Foot, Seorle, and Toulmin) ottention is directed to C. E. Foore, the ""naturalistic follecy"" and the attemot to overcome this dichotomy by means of definitions. with the aid of recent discussions of the enalytic-synthetic distinction it is concluded that what Foore\'s open question argument shows is neither that moral torms refer to non-netural proverties, nor thet they are cognitively meaningless, but that they recresent cluster concepts. In the light of regarding a moral system in terms of a Quinian field of beliefs e system of moral reasoning similar to Richerd Brandt\'s ""qualified ettitude method"" is seen to be clausible. while the morelly right cannot be defined in terms of Cod\'s will any more than it can be defined in terms of eny other single criterion 1 2 there may in fect be some good reason to put some principle thet refers to Cod or His will at the center of one\'s moral beliefs, and the reasons offered by such writers as P. T. Ceach, Dewi 2. Phillips, and John Hick are considered. But if and only if Cod is understood to be morelly good cen we say that e life that acquiesces in His purpose would definitely be ultimately vindiceted and not brought into question by other morel criterie. The meaning of \'God is good\' is analyzed in such a way thet it is not necessery for us to judge that God is good for us to know what such en essertion meens. Neither is it necessery for us to judge God\'s individual commands to be good in order for it to be retional for us to believe in HIS goodness. This is not beceuse efforts to justify the belief in God\'s goodness on linguistic grounds (Burton F. Porter) or metaphysical grounds (Aquines, James Roas, Cherles Hertshorne) are adequate, but because ance en individual has some initiel reeson to hold to a certain bolief the rationelity of his continuing to hold it depends not on his ability to justify it, but in its ability to with- stand critical atteck. For the believerto have some reason to adhere to such e belief the purported will of Cod must at some point correspond to his own judgment es to what is right--terwise how could he be some- one who trusts in Cod,--but this need not be the autonomous judgment of the secular men, but it may be that of the man who under the influence of religious experience or worship ""sees"" things differently then he would have otherwise. The possibility of falsifying his belief comes when on other occasions his autonomous judgment conflicts with Cod\'s purported will and so leads him to question either the goodness of Cod or his criterie for knowing the will of Cod, but, contrery to what sould 3 seem to be the position of some proponents of the autonomy thesis, it is in no wey irretional or immorel, given the believer\'s set of beliefs, for him to allow his belief in Cod\'s goodness, and his belief that God wills a perticuler ection, to override and discredit his autonomous judgment on meny particular occesions.']"

Slow and fast wave disturbances incident at 5000 km. altitude at the frequencies 100, 3.0, 1/3, and 1/300 cps. were analyzed. A model tonosphere developed from existing rocket and satellite data for conditions of midday and midlatitude at sunspot minimum was used in the calculations. The cold plasma dispersion relation was written conveniently in terms of the localized disturbance factor and the ionospheric conductivity tensor elements. The localized disturbances were found to produce large vertical electric fields in the neutral atmosphere for the incident slow waves in the micropulsation range and the incident fast wave at 100 cps. Localization causés strong mode coupling in the lower D region and the coupling coefficients are larger than the quartic roots at 1/300 c/s. Charge exchange of o* and O results in an enhanced Pedersen conductivity region which in some cases acts as ar cavity wall for wave energy storage. Charge exchange also causes some absorption at Pcl frequencies in the range 150-250 km. The conductivity of the Earth's surface is included and found to result in almost total reflection at ground level for all frequencies considered. Incident slow mode signals at 3.0 cps. undergo polarization reversal at 1000 km. and then propagate mostly in the R mode through the ionosphere.

The sociology of science provides a context in which the role of the scientist is investigated; i.e., science as an information processing activity, the scientist as an information processing agent, and the general functions of the infor- mation environment of science are studied. The interface between in- formation science and the sociology of science derives from the joining of an information theoretic stance vis-a-vis the complex social phe- nomenon known as science with behavioral methodology and a sociolog- ical theory of the middle range. The scientist\'s role is conceptualized in terms of his basic (fundamental) or applied orientations to his work. Instead of relying on an a priori two-type dichotomy (i.e., basic vs. applied), scaling techniques were used to rank scientists on a continuum from basic to applied according to their reading habits of professional periodic literature. The scaling techniques employed were modifications of the basic Thurstone variety. The scientist\'s scale score or rank was con- ceived as his scientific mission and the variance about that score was taken to reflect the diffuseness of his interests. It was found that subjects did not cluster at the ends of the continuum (thus refuting the two-type dichotomy) and that there was a distinct tendency toward ii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission the middle. The scale scores approached a normal distribution on the continuum. Using factor analysis, a seven item scale of professional involvement was developed. Scientists with more basic research inter- ests (higher scale scores) exhibited significantly higher professional involvement. Scientists with less diffuse, more narrowly defined in- terests also tended to be more professionally involved. It therefore follows, and the analysis bears out the fact that, scientists with more basic research interests define their interests more narrowly. Multiple discriminant function analysis was used to discriminate three distinct groups according to their degree of professional involvement: BASIC, MIXED, and APPLIED. As correlaries to these findings, an analysis of scientific elitism was included in this study. A ten item scale of scientific elitism was constructed using factor analysis. Elites were identified using a reputational sociometric technique. There was a distinct tendency for elites to cluster at the basic sector of the continuum. Elites have more narrowly defined, less diffuse interests and signif- icantly greater professional involvement and visibility than non-elites. The theroetical model of information processing is then inves- tigated relative to the scientist\'s mission vis-a-vis his basic and applied interests. The model is viewed as a vehicle by which we might approach a middle range theory. The elements of the model of the in- formation processor (Ego) are: 1. information needs (internally and externally generated); 2. information use (primarily cognitive pro- cesses); and 3. information flow (information procurement when informa- tion flows to Ego and communication when\'information flows away from Ego.) Needs act as a catalyst to procurement except for the case of iii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission accidental acquisition of information. Two processes are described: 1. Pure - B processes involve only Ego and stem from internally gen- erated needs; 2. A + B processes involve Ego and Alter (others) and have externally generated needs. Information processing encompasses either or both processes. Correlation and partial correlation techniques were used to analyze subject\'s ratings of scientific communication media. Media which were thought to be easiest to use were also perceived as best qualitatively. When controlling on ""ease of use,"" the correlation between ""quantity of information"" and ""quality of information"" is sig- nificantly reduced. Scientists get the largest amount of their infor- mation from sources which are easiest to use and most accessible. This is substantiated by the fact that when controlling on ""quality"", the correlation between ""quantity"" and ""ease of use"" actually increases. A large amount of information is procured from sources where there is little time investment, i.e., reviews, abstracts, Chemical Abstracts, etc. Scientists with more basic orientations generally gave all media lower ratings than scientists with more applied research interests. In certain hypothetical information-gathering situations, the BASIC group was found to be significantly different from the APPLIED group because of their greater preference for non-personal, literature oriented methods of information procurement. As for choices of cos- mopolitan (extra-organizational) or local (in house) sources of infor- mation, there were no significant differences between the BASIC and APPLIED groups.

Experiments show that this distribution is primarily due to the very great physiological tolerance of lucinaceans to tem- perature and salinity fluctuations and to stagnant conditions. Feeding processes are also important. There is abundant food present in most shallow water environments but this consists primarily of microbial populations on plant detrital particles which are larger than those normally accomodated by suspension feeders. The Lucinacea generally lack complex ctenidial sort- ing mechanisms and are able to accept and process large detri- tal particles. They therefore exploit food supplies not avail- able to most other suspension feeding bivalves. Investigation of five Caribbean lucinids shows these species co-occur frequently but are not correlated in their distributions. The eurytopic species do, however, occur more frequently and in a wider range of environments than their comparatively stenotopic lucinid relatives. Differential physiological tolerance is therefore a primary factor in the niche specificity of individual lucinid species. Four homogeneous areas within beds of the marine angio- sperm Thalassia were selected along a composite onshore- offshore gradient for detailed study. Eleven environmental variables and molluscan and echinoderm abundance were sampled at monthly intervals for one year. Environmental conditions were generally more extreme, and their variance greatest, near- shore and decroased significantly with distance from shore. Environmental predictability and cumulative diversity (H) in- creased with distance from shore, whereas abundance was great- est in the more high stress environments. Over the year popu- lation stability was at least as great in the unpredictable, low diversity environments as in the more predictable, high diversity environments. Bivalves collected from the low diversity environments were markedly eurytopic forms (mostly Lucinidae) whereas the highest diversity area contained predominantly stenotopic taxa. Typical suspension feeders were dominant only in the most diverse area, whereas more generalized feeders dominated the higher stress environments. There was no correlation between bivalve diversity and the total quantity of food avail- able, but bivalve diversity increased with the variety of food. In multivariate regression analyses, the environmental variables as a set were highly significant in ""explaining"" the population variables in any one area but subsets, or individual variables, were not significant. Between areas, the environ- mental set alone was not significant and a full 31 parameter model was required to ""explain"" the distributions. It is suggested that catastrophes, and other long term phenomena, and biological factors, such as predation, are of great impor- tance in determining the differences in fauna between these areas.

It deals with literary history to the extent that it centers on the practice of one storyteller. However, its point of departure is more general. It asks--and offers answers-- to two questions: What are the problems facing any author who tells a story abridging the conventions of everyday reality? What are the ways to meet those problems? I have attempted to isolate the devices of narrative tech- nique which any author of fiction can call upon to convey fantas- tic material to a rational public. Since these devices operate to cushion the shock of confronting rationally inexplicable ele- ments in fiction, they are termed the techniques of softening In my estimate, there are six such principal devices. Three of them operate within a text to assuage the rational reader, three of them operate extra-textually as part of the reader\'s analysis of the events presented. It seems natural, and indeed necessary, to consider these devices in conjunction with the intensity of the fantastic ultimately established. Presence, possible presence, and absence of the rationally inexplicable appear the only workable and sufficient distinctions. When these distinctions are combined with the six devices into a table, a form of structural analysis becomes possible for any author\'s fantastic fiction. Thirty-five pieces of Hoffmann\'s shorter fiction are considered. Substantive discussion is given to Das Fräulein von Scuderi, Ritter Gluck, Die Bergwerke zu Falun, Die Abenteuer der Silvester-Nacht, Das öde Haus, Klein Zaches genannt Zinnober, Ignaz Denner, and Nachricht aus dem Leben eines bekannten Mannes. Walpole\'s Castle of Otranto, Irving\'s Bold Dragoon, Chamisso\' Peter Schlemihl, and Poe\'s Masque of the Red Death are also discussed. There are several results for the analysis of Hoffmann\'s narrative technique. A ""middle realm"" in Hoffmann\'s fantastic narration emerges, a statistical preference for controlling affective response through softening or the fantastic ""reality"" in his narration. The exact narrative methods for achieving the ""middle realm"" are illustrated. Consideration is given to the issue of quality, with the argument made that outside the ""middle realm"" Hoffmann\'s fantastic fiction fails. Ignaz Denner and Das Fräulein von Scuderi are cited as such failures. Further, a form of total softening--removal of all fantas- tic content by means of a narrative frame--was discovered in Ritter Gluck. This would seem to be a structural discovery of some interpretive significance, for it demonstrates a simple and seemingly hesitant narrative technique in an emerging author, a technique which was later refined and articulated into softening integrated with the entire construct of narration.

Sites of recovery of subfossil lemuroids are widely distributed over the island; available c14 dates range from 2,850 to 980 years B. P. The extinct indriid subfamily Archaeolemurinae contains three species: Archaeolemur majori, A. edwardsi and Hadropithecus stenognathus. This group of prosimians was studied with three primary objects in view: to determine to what extent they were, as has been frequently claimed, ""advanced"" relative to other lemuroids; to elucidate their ecological relationships, and to explain, as far as possible, their cranial rchitecture in functional terms. The study indicates that the archaeolemurines were not advanced over the general indriic condition in their neural or peripheral sensory organisation; a typical prosimian pattern is retained in the brain and in the visual, olfactory and auditory systems. For in- stance, it is virtually certain that the archaeolemurines possessed all the external attributes of the prosimian olfactory apparatus, including labial vibrissae, a naked, tethered rhinarium and a naked philtrum. It is also likely that their eyes retained afoveate retinas. These animals most closely approached Old World higher primates in their masticatory apparatus, but analysis shows this resemblance to have been entirely superficial, albeit probably related to the action of similar selective pressures. Cranial structure in the archaeolemurines was largely governed by the masticatory system, which was very strongly developed, especially in A. edwardsi and Hadropithecus, buti which was at the same time designed to eliminate the occurrence of stresses at the temporomandibula: joint during mastication. In elevation of the jaw this was accomplished essentially through the action of the posterior temporalis and the masseter/internal pterygoid muscles as a couple acting around the mandibular insertion of the sphenomandibular ligament, while during lateral motion a similar result was achieved by the geometry of a system relying chiefly on the action of the contralateral posterior temporalis. The resultant occlusal forces at the dentition were absorbed through a pyramidal facial structure ideally designed to perform such a function. The adaptations of the crania, and particularly the dentitions, of the archaeolemurines, indicate that these animals represent an adaptive radiation closely paralleling that of the large terrestrial African monkeys. Archaeolemur appears to have been a browser similar to the common baboon Papio, while Hadropithecus represents a highly specialised grazer reminiscent of the gelada baboon, Theropithecus.

The first problem deals with waves emerging from an im- pact load suddenly applied uniformly on the surface of a cyl- indrical cavity. Due to the restriction of plane strain axial symmetry at the instant of impact, a pulse travels outwards in the form of cylindrical waves. Perzyna\'s constitutive equa- tion for an isotropic work hardening material, together with the inelastic work as loading/unloading criterion, is applied for the presentation of the viscoplastic behavior under the present ""multidimensional"" state of stress. The system of partial differential equations is solved numerically along characteristic lines in the r-t plane. On the basis of these computations: 1) the influence of the several physical para- meters (i.e., viscosity coefficient, work hardening parameter, magnitude of the applied pressure) will be discussed and 2) the existence of an elastic region within the inelastically deforming medium will be shown. The second problem is an attempt to incorporate strain rate effects into an unloading problem. This wave propagation in a rod is used as the physical model for this effort. Malvern\'s constitutive equation is generalized to include the unloading processes for a material with a bilinear quasi-static stress-strair - curve characterized by kinematic hardening. The method of solution is numerical along the characteristic lines in the x-t plane. It will be shown: 1) the inelastic defor- - mations during unloading affect considerably the residual strain distribution and 2) by the end of the transient phenom- enon a lower ""quasi plateau"" is developed along the bar.

315,,"pilbeam, carol coke",ph.d.,geophysics,acoustic velocities and energy losses in granular aggregates,yale university,1971,"[""SUMMARY Unconsolidated aggregates occur in several geologic settings of interest. Examples are marine sediments and beach sands, lunar surface soils, and, if the fluid pres- sure should be about equal to the overload pressure, par- tial melts in the earth at depth. The properties of such aggregates are not well known. When studying the behavior of a complex system, it is important to know what factors can contribute to the behavior in order to extrapolate the observed properties to other conditions. At low net pres- sures (intergranular contact areas small compared to grain size), the bulk dynamic properties of aggregates are deter- mined in large part by the interparticle contact properties. A set of relations, collectively called contact theory, have been used to describe the dynamic behavior of pairs and regu- lar arrays of uniform spheres in elastic contact. It was the purpose of this study to compare some of the predictions of contact theory with experimental studies on irregularly packed aggregates of various types and sizes of clean and lubricated particles. Extensional and torsional velocities in granular aggre- gates were found to increase. with confining pressure (from O to 1 bar) while the associated fractional energy losses per cycle decreased. Velocities varied as the 1/3 power of pressure for aggregates of clean, spherical particles, as the 1/3.5-1/5 power for lubricated spherical particles, and as the 1/4-1/6 power for clean and lubricated angular parti- cles. Lubrication raised the velocities, at a given pres- sure, of the spherical particle aggregates but not of the angular particle aggregates. The above results can be in- terpreted in terms of contact theory modified to include the changing number of interparticle contacts with pressure and lubrication. Also interpretable within the framework of con- tact theory are the observed decrease of velocity with de- creasing spherical grain size and increasing angularity and the approach of the velocity of aggregates of particles with some plastic deformation at contacts to a terminal velocity at about 1 bar pressure. Values of Q-1 were independent of vibration frequency (1 to 20 kHz) and amplitude. Lubrica- tion generally increased relative energy losses, sometimes by a factor of 10. The energy dissipation at these pres- sures which is thought to be related to lightly made con- tacts; is not adequately described by any present theory. The measured extensional velocities of clean aggregates at pressures of about 1 bar ranged from about 0.3 to 9.6 km/sec and the associated values of Q-1, from 4 x 10-3 to 2 x 10-2 Extrapolations of these values to lunar condi- tions agree well with the low velocities and low Q-l's ob- served in studies of man-made impacts on the moon.

The results support the hypothesis that where sympatric, Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space by Yellowheaded Blackbirds. I. Nesting success in marsh and upland habitat. Marsh nesting populations had greater nest success than those in uplands due to a larger proportion of nests destroyed by pre- dators in upland habitats. Predation pressure on marsh nests was negatively correlated with the depth of water beneath the nest. The structure and phenology of marsh vegetation plays an important role in providing an abundance of song perches, structural reference for delineating territories, and nest support early in the spring thus making possible dense and synchronous nesting. Upland nesting is delayed and protracted as spring growth makes the necessary structure available sequentially. It is considered unlikely that genetic separation exists between marsh and upland populations. It is proposed that habitat selection involves a degree of site tenacity by adults and selection for optimal habitats by first time breeders. The relationships between density, nest success; and the function of territoriality lead to the conclusion that territorial behavior limits breeding density. II. Spatial and temporal patterns of nesting activity and success. Nesting colonies of Redwings in marshes are larger and tend to be more synchronous than colonies in upland habitats of comparable area. These variations in timing are probably correlated with the phenology of the vegetation and not with the size of the breeding colony. Earlier nesting may be selectively advantageous due to a seasonal trend of increasing predation. The survival value of large colony size and synchronous nesting, for Redwings in the colonies studied, was a reduced predation rate on a percentage basis due to the presence of a large number of prey. The Holling predation model is applied as a possible interpretation of predation rates on different sized nesting colonies. III. Growth rate and food of nestlings in marsh and upland habitats. Growth rate and the incidence of starvation are similar for Redwing nestlings in marsh and upland habitats. It is suggested that the relative abundance of food is approximately the same for nestlings in either marshes or up- lands, but that a higher absolute abundance of food in marshes makes large dense nesting colonies possible. The relationship between nesting density and food supply is not simple because obvious differences in the phenology of vegetation used as nest support are also correlated with colony size and density.

Surface diffusion coefficients for the system stearic acid on (0001) a-alumina have been measured under various surface conditions. Higashi's model of predicting the dependence of surface diffusion coefficient on surface coverage in the submonolayer region was modified. The modified model showed definite advantage over the original one in comrelating the experimental data from various sources. The effect of the surface coverage of one species on the surface diffusion coefficient of another species has been studied. The follow- ing model systems were chosen in this work: (1) stearic acid/water on (0001) surface of a-alumina, and (2) stearic acid/water on KRS-5 surface. The rate of surface diffusion was measured as a function of surface coverage of adsorbed water, 0. In system (1), the diffusion rate is small at e = 0.4, increased by over two orders of magnitude as 0 approaches one and decreased rapidly as e was increased beyond one. While in system (2), a rather weak dependence of the diffusion rate of stearic acid on the amount of adsorbed water was found. In the study of adsorption from solution, Harkins assumption about the amount and orientation of the adsorbed species was examined. This assumption was found to be invalid for the system germanium/stearic acid (from carbon tetrachloride). On the other hand, stearic acid molecules adsorbed from solution in carbon tetrachloride onto the surface of alumina showed some degree of orientation.

By semiclassical, one means that translational motion is treated classically and the internal motions of the molecules are treated quantum mechanically. The approximations range from a multi-trajectory method valid for large relative energy changes to the sudjen approximation valid only for very small relative energy changes. It is shown that any three dimensional problem may be simplified considerably by treating the orbital angular momentum in the classical limit and the molecular rotations in the sudden limit. The appropriate expressions for obtaining transition probabilities, cross sections, and angular distributions are derived for several of the approximations. A three dimensional calculation of vibrational transition probabilities and cross sections for the case of an atom striking a diatomic molecule is presented. These calculations are carried out in the sudden limit, a high energy approximation in which the internal states of the molecule are taken to be degenerate. The results are discussed in the light of presently available experimental data and as they bear on previously used models in vibrationally inelastic scattering. A comparison of cross sections averaged over internal molecular coordinates to cross sections calculated from a potential averaged over internal molecular coordinates is presented in order to determine the validity of treating high energy molecular scattering results in terms of averaged potentials.

The incident light polarizes a helium atom. The polarized atom inter- acts via dipole-dipole interaction with a second atom and induces a dipole in it, which then radiates the scattered light. This process leads to almost completely depolarized scattered light and almost isotropic distribution of the scattered light. These results are in good agreement with experiment. The experimental spectral density of the scattered light has a single peak at a frequency shift of twice the roton energy. This can be understood if the interaction between elementary excitations is taken into account. The roton peak is shown to be due to a roton bound state of d-symmetry. The spectral distribution of the scattered light is calculated using a pseudopotential for the interaction of rotons and qualitative agreement with experiment obtained. The pseudopotential model is inadequate to explain both roton bound states and the scattering of 2 rotons. A more realistic model is constructed for the interaction of 2 rotons using the Feynman- Cohen model of a roton. It is shown that at large separation the interaction of 2 rotons has a dipolar form which results from the interaction of the backflow fields of the rotons. At small separation the interaction is shown to be repulsive. A variational calculation of the binding energy of 2 rotons in a d-state is made using the above dipolar interaction. A bound state is obtained in reasonable agree- ment with experiment. The long range interaction and bound states are shown to be unimportant in the scattering of 2 rotons. A variational calculation of the scattering of 2 rotons is made by assuming various forms for the short range repulsive interaction. Agreement with experiment is obtained if the potential is strong and has a range 1 - 2 R. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.']"

Shifts in zooplankton composition and size distribution toward small forms had oc- curred eight years after alewives were introduced. A partial reversal of these effects, including an increase in the relative importance of large species and a size increase in at least one species (Daphnia galeata mendotae), followed an alewife die-off. After the die-off the recovery of a hypolimnetic species (Daphnia longiremis) was retarded relative to that of the epilimnetic Daphnia dubia, probably because of restriction of the former\'s reproductive rate by low hypolimnetic temp- eratures. Section II Two factors influencing natural estimates of Daphnia mortality made with the ""egg ratio"" method are considered: age-specific mortality influencing the egg-age distribution and horizontal variation in Daphnia population parameters. When mortality is concentrated among egg-bearing individuals of a computer model population, the egg-age distribution is skewed toward young eggs, and recruitment and mortality estimates made with the egg ratio method may be unacceptably high. Such estimates are less likely to be biased when mortality is concentrated among immature individuals. Horizontal variations in Daphnia abundance and in the ratio eggs:females (E) in Lake Wononskopomuc have been demonstrated, with both abundance and E being lower at stations 6 m deep than at deeper ones. In addition, Daphnia egg-age distributions in Wononskopomuc have been considered in light of the nature of potential mortality sources and the egg-age distributions likely to be produced by different preda- tors.

324,,"storms, michael david",ph.d.,social psychology,videotape and the attribution process: changing actors' and observers' points of view,yale university,1971,"['ABSTRACT Kelley (1967) proposed that individuals interpret their own and other peoples\' behavior and infer internal, dispositional causes or external, situational causes for that behavior. Jones and Nisbett (1971) posited that attributions may differ for individuals inter- preting their own behavior and individuals interpreting others\' behavior. Actors tend to attribute their own behavior relatively more to the situation; observers tend to attribute the actor\'s behavior relatively more to the actor\'s disposition. The present paper suggests that differences in actors\' and observers\' visual orientation toward an event may account for attributional differences. Actors may focus more on aspects of the situation and less on their own behavior; conse- quently, they perceive their behavior as caused by the situation. Observers, on the other hand, focus more on the actor and less on the situation; consequently, they attribute the actor\'s behavior more to dispositions within him. An experiment was designed to test the effects of different visual orientations on actors\' and observers\' attributions. A brief ""getting acquainted"" conversation between two actors was videotaped from different camera angles. In addition, an observer was assigned to watch each actor. Actors were shown a videotape replay of the conversation recorded either from their original point of view (toward the other actor) or from a new perspective (toward themselves). Likewise, observers viewed a videotape taken from their original point of view (toward their matched actor) or from a new orientation (toward the other actor) Some actors and observers saw no videotape replay. A questionnaire measured subjects\' attributions of their own behavior (for actors) or their matched actor\'s behavior (for observers). Role and videotape orientation interacted significantly to affect subjects\' , attributions of the actor\'s behavior. When subjects saw no videotape or saw a videotape which repeated their original orientations, actors attributed their behavior relatively more to situational causes than did observers. When videotape presented a new orientation to subjects, this pattern was exactly reversed. Self-viewing actors attributed their behavior relatively less to sit- uational causes than did observers. In addition, self-observation may have influenced actors\' typical self-image defense mechanisms. Actors who did not see themselves on videotape and who perceived themselves as somewhat less friendly were more likely to attribute their unfriendliness to the situation, but this relationship did not hold for self-viewing actors. Possible mechanisms by which videotape reorientation affected subjects\' attributions are discussed, including: 1) changes in the information made available about the event, 2) changes in the saliency of such information, and 3) changes in subjects\' attributional ""set.\' Implications are drawn for the use of videotape in psychotherapy and T-groups. It is suggested that video- tape self-confrontation may affect patients in such a way as to lead to adaptive or maladaptive changes in behavior and self-image.

Data from time-lapse photography indicate that the primary morphological response, tip-swelling, begins 2-3 hours after transfer from red to blue light. A difference in total-RNA base composition between filamentous and prothallial gametophytes appears to reside in a difference in the relative amounts of chloroplast ribosomal- RNA (rRNA) between these two growth types. Phosphorus-32 labelling shows that an increased rate of chloroplast rRNA is not detected until about 1 day after transfer from red to blue light; although cytoplasmic rRNA synthesis is stimulated much sooner. In addition, other experiments indicate that RNA of these gametophytes cannot readily be labelled with radioactive uridine. These data suggest that uridine incorporation is not a satisfactory assay for RNA synthesis in fern gametophytes.

HBr+ was the first molecule studied. Emission due to photoionization (HBr (X1x+ v"") + hv HBr+ (2)+ v\') + e-) followed by fluorescence (HBr (2E+, vi) ; HBr+ (201)) + hu where 1=1/2 or 3/2) was observed in the 3000-4000A region. All bands with vl > 2 were missing from the spectrum. Franck - Condon calculations using Morse potentials combined with the photoelectron spectrum of HBr indicate equal intensities for the transitions HBr* (2), v\'=1) HBr* and HBr+ (2ct, v\'=2) HBr+ (2hi, v""=0) Therefore predissociation of the levels v\' 2 is strongly suggested. In addition, relative intensities for transitions from the v\'=1 and 0 vibronic levels were measured. Theoretical Franck - Condon factors were computed under the assumption of a Morse potential. The ratio of the theoretical Franck - Condon factors for the 0-1 and 0-0 transitions differed significantly from the corresponding ratio obtained from the experi- mental relative intensities. Similar theoretical and experimental ratios for the 1-0 and 0-0 transitions barely agreed within experimental uncertainty. A further investigation was made by taking a photoelectron and ion emission spectrum, (photoionization was produced by microwave discharge). The ion emission results confirmed the accuracy of the F.C.F. ratios obtained from the fluorescent photoionization experiment. The photoelectron spectrum combined with information from pre- viously published results indicates that the 2 et state is highly perturbed and has a potential maximum which facilitates predissociation by tunneling for v\'=0 and 1 rovibronic levels. The incongruity between experimental and theoretical F.C.F.\'s could not be fully explained but suggestions for further work were advanced. + Fluorescent photoionization spectra of CS and N o+ were also taken. The spectrum of N20+ was 2 not sufficiently resolved to yield any information about predissociation, but the CS2 + spectrum showed strong cs(15-1n) transitions. The energetics of the CS2 and CS2 states suggest that the fragment resulted from a Rydberg state of CS2 not from a vibronic state of CS2+. Bonding characteristics for N20+ and CS2+ electronic states were inferred from relative intensity measurements. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The necessary data were obtained by determining the differential capacity curve, the streaming electrode potential and the surface tension at the point of zero charge. The adsorption of KBr from KBr + KF has been shown to be similar to KC1 from KC1 + KF if the data in the same range of specifically adsorbed charge are compared. The results at larger values of specifically adsorbed charge have not previously been observed for halide systems. They can be explained by assuming a standard free energy with both linear and quadratic terms and variable isotherm parameters. The bromide and chloride results imply that the simpler picture for the iodide ion is due to the limited range of surface charge which has been studied. Within the range of surface charge available, 6 amino-hexanoic acid is maximally adsorbed when the surface charge density is -6, with a quadratic standard free energy of adsorption. The expectation that this system would show some of the characteristics of ionic adsorption proved to be incorrect. The quadratic standard free energy, which implies the adsorption of a point dipole, indicates that in this system adsorption should be considered to occur in the entire double layer rather than only in the inner layer. This assumption is necessitated by the dipole being si gnificantly larger than the in- ner layer. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

From the difficulties confronted in the preparation of the compounds, it was concluded that the lone-pair electrons on nitrogen atoms in organosilylamines are less available toward coordination than those in alkylamines. Presumably this is due to pT-dT partial double bond character in the N-Si bond. In the stable transition metal complexes, which were obtained with considerable difficulties, the lone-pair electrons on the nitrogen atom would be removed from N-Si partial double bond. This probably is the main reason for the rearrangement in certain metal complexes, and for the easy hydrolysis and decomposition of other organosilylamine adducts. To synthesize the above metal complexes a few new organo- silylamines were used as well as those that had been previously prepared by others. In the process of preparation of ligands, six new organosilyl polyamines were synthesized.

Qualitatively, a first order perturbation theory description of the collision process accounts for the selection rules of the ob- served collision induced transitions. Double resonance studies have been made of collision induced tran- sitions occurring in pure HCN and in HCN in the presence of He, Ar, or Xe. Double resonance intensities and phase shifts have been determined for a number of HCN 1-doublets. Also, collision broadening rotational linewidth parameters have been determined for pure HCN and for each rare gas collision partner. A computer program is used to calculate intensities and phase shifts in terms of a set of collisional rate con- stants. It has been found that it is not possible to determine a unique set of rate constants on the basis of the experimental data. However, general theoretical arguments are presented that allow a preferred set to be determined for each collision partner. Experimental studies are presented that provide evidence that quantum coherence effects are being observed that must be accounted for in any improved analysis of double resonance data.

Lewis Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. I Abstract Over the years several social scientists have suggested that the benefits of integrated education for blacks will be conditioned by their social acceptance (or lack of acceptance) from members of the white majority. This suggestion is derived both from reference group theory and from research findings dealing with the effects of psychological stress on the task performance capabilities of individuals. The present research represents an initial attempt to test this hypothesis for both black students in majority white classrooms and for white students in majority black classrooms. In addition, hypotheses were developed and tested concerning the effects of classroom racial composition on the friendship choices of students and the general effects of social accept- ance by classmates on the academic achievement of students. This study was conducted in the public school system of one large Northeastern city. The sample included all children in 36 sixth grade classrooms in 18 different schools. These schools were randomly selected from a matrix representing the racial and social class distribution of all racially mixed elementary schools in the city. Data to test the hypotheses were derived from a variety of sources including formal school records, questionnaires, and a sociometric test. A variety of statistical procedures including multiple regression analysis have been employed in testing our hypotheses. Using Pearsonian correlation techniques we found that as classroom percent own race decreased: 1) black girls became friendlier to other black girls, black boys, and white boys; 2) white girls became friendlier Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. II to white boys and black boys; 3) black boys became friendlier to black girls; 4) white boys became friendlier to white girls. These findings suggest the importance of cross-sex friendship choices for students and clearly suggest that blacks (particularly girls) are more sensitive to changes in classroom racial composition than whites. This suggestion is supported by the results of a multiple regression analysis in which we controlled for family SES, classroom SES, GPA (sixth) and absences (sixth). Even under these stringent control conditions classroom percent black had a significant effect on the friendliness of black girls to other black girls and to black boys and the friendliness of black boys to black boys. We also found that classroom racial composition had no effect on the tendency of students to prefer members of their own race as friends-Town group preference). In terms of social acceptance and academic achievement we found that GPA (but not the reading achievement) of students increases as their social acceptance by classmates increases. For girls (both black and white) this effect persisted even after adjusting for the possibly invalidating effects of third variables (family SES, classroom SES, and tested intelligence). Moreover, our findings indicate that the relationship between social acceptance and GPA is conditioned by the racial composi- tion of classrooms. When controlled for third variables, social accept- ance by the majority had a significant effect on the GPA of whites (both boys and girls) and black boys only when they were members of the major- ity. For black girls, however, social acceptance by white girls (when whites were in the majority) and black girls (when blacks were in the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

This finding also suggests that black girls may be particularly sensitive to variations in class- room racial composition. Finally, we found that both socially accepted and non-accepted white students in majority black classrooms performed as well academi- cally as students of comparable intelligence in majority white class- rooms. Similarly, socially accepted blacks in majority white classrooms performed as well (but not better) academically than blacks of comparable intelligence in majority black classrooms. That is, being in majority white classrooms and socially accepted by the white majority did not improve their academic achievement.

Measurements of standard stars have been used to calibrate the system absolutely. Observations of 148 stars are used to examine the dependence of certain color in- dices on temperature and metal abundance. A color index strad- dling the blanketing discontinuity near 4000 A is a useful in- dicator of metal abundance in G dwarfs of roughly solar com- position. However, the interpretation of an index monitoring CN absorption as a measure of metal content in K giants is less secure. 10-color observations of 31 elliptical galaxies, largely members of double galaxies or small groups, are pre- sented. To within the accuracy of the present observations, the colors of these elliptical galaxies form a one-parameter family. This single parameter is identified as the galaxy luminosity. The fact that elliptical galaxies of a given lum- inosity have identical colors suggests their use as standard sources for the investigation of galactic and intergalactic reddening and the cosmological expansion. No variations in galaxy colors that correlated with group properties, types of companions, or the presence of optical line or radio emission were found.

The strengths of the absorption features CN and Mg ""b"" plus MgH, together with blanketing caused by metallic lines near 3800 A, increase monotonically with increasing luminosity. A reddening-free line absorption index monitoring CN and Mg can be used to determine the absolute magnitude of elliptical galaxies with an accuracy of approximately +0.5 magnitude. Four red dwarf ellipticals of high surface bright- ness, three of which have been observed on this 10-color system, appear to constitute a separate class of elliptical galaxy. Several of their properties can be understood in terms of a strong tidal interaction with a nearby, more massive, companion. The technique of quadratic programming as directed to the problem of galaxy synthesis is described. The method offers significant advantages over the trial-and-error approach usually employed. This technique is applied to the 38-color data of Spinrad and Taylor (1971a) and the 10-color photometry presented here. The results indicate that estimates of mean line strengths in external galaxies by means of population syn- thesis are well determined. Ages based on the main-sequence turnoff point are uncertain by at least a factor of two. Mass- to-light ratios of the computed populations are uncertain by factors of five to ten.

Gamma rays are detected by a coinci- dence between light pulses in a scintillator at the top of the detector and pulses of Kerenkov light collected by a mirror at the bottom of the detector. Gamma rays convert or Compton scatter in the scintillator, and the resulting electrons emit cerenkov radiation as they move through the 2 m gas column between the scintillator and the mirror. The detector's efficiency and angular response were calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation and checked experimentally by a calibration with garma rays and electrons. The detector was flown in a balloon from Palestine, Texas on 29 September, 1970 and observed M87, the Crab Nebula, and the atmospheric gamma ray background. The background measurements, combined with other measurements at higher energies, show a flattening of the atmospheric gamma ray spectrum below 50 MeV, caused by the superposition of a pion- produced gamma ray spectrum peaked at 70 MeV on a power law bremsstrahlung spectrum. No gamma ray flux was seen from M87 with a 95% confidence upper limit of F (>15MeV) significant Y flux was detected from the direction of the Crab Nebula, although a lo excess of gamma ray counts was observed.

A large body of evidence points to the fact that the mechanism of the formation of these Diels-Alder adducts was of a biradical nature, and consequently, the composition of the cis and trans 1,4 adducts was kinetically controlled. The thermal cycloaddition of butadiene and cis or trans CIFC=CFCI, in addition to yielding 1,2 cycloadducts gave respectively 2. 1% and 2. 4% 1, 4 adducts with a loss of halogen configuration of 42.5% and 23%. Clearly then, the biradical pathway played a role in the Diels-Alder addition and most likely its role was largely prepond- erant over the concerted one, On going from butadiene to trans, trans-2, 4-hexadiene the cis and trans CCIF=CCIF gave respectively 16.8% and 19. 4% 1, 4 adducts with a loss of halogen configuration of 8. 1% and 5%. We attribute this increase in both 1, 4 adducts yield and stereospecificity to the interven- ing or large increase of the concerted pathway due to the two methyls which slow the biradicalmechanism while accelerating the concerted one.

342,,"cesarsky, catherine jeanne",ph.d.,astronomy;astrophysics,interactions of cosmic rays with hydromagnetic waves in the galaxy.,harvard university,1972,"['ii ABSTRACT The possibility that ultrarelativistia cosmic rays are confined to the galactic disk as a result of their interactions with hydromagnetic waves is examined. Cosmic rays themselves, when they stream at velo- cities in excess of the Alfvèn velocity in the medium, gen- erate waves; the waves are damped by the collisions between the charged and neutral particles in the interstellar medium. If only these two processes controlled the wave spectrum, the diffusion of cosmic rays of different energies would proceed at very different rates -- a result that is difficult to reconcile with cosmic ray observations. A similar difficulty is encountered when cosmic rays are assumed to be confined exclusively by their resonant interactions, through high harmonics, with waves much shorter than their Larmor radii. Turbulent gas motions in the galaxy are a possible source of long hydromagnetic waves, with wavelengths of the order of a few parsecs. By analogy with hydrodynamic turbulence, we assume that nonlinear effects cause the energy in these long waves to be transmitted to waves of successively smaller size. This process, together with the different mechanisms tending to damp the waves, determines the wave spectrum. The diffusion of cosmic rays in the presence of given spectrum of hydromagnetic waves is parameterized by their mean free path, A. Cosmic rays are scattered in pitch = iii angle by their resonant interactions with hydromagnetic waves; they are also mirror reflected by magnetosonic (or magneto- acoustic) waves. Both effects have to be considered in the evaluation of A. Because of charged-neutral collision damping the power needed to sustain a spectrum of waves that extends to the shortest wavelengths of interest in an intercloud medium with currently accepted properties (nh = 0.2 cm-³, n° 0.02cm -3, - , T = 1000°K), is unacceptably high. In a more diffuse medium, with a density of hydrogen in the range 0.02 - 0.04 cm-3, the power dissipated by the waves is sufficient to maintain the medium at a high temperature, and thus high- ly ionized; then, the effect of charged-neutral collision damping is of no importance. Short magnetoacoustic waves are damped by thermal conduction, but, under certain assumptions, a spectrum of Alfvèn waves may develop. The mean free path of ultrarelativisitic cosmic rays in the presence of the resulting spectrum of waves, is either constant or approxi- mates a power law in the rigidity, with a small exponent. A model for the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy is proposed, in which cosmic rays traverse the gas disk, of thickness 300 pc, at large speeds, but diffuse slowly in 2 slabs of hot and diffuse gas, 200 pc thick, at each side of the gas disk. It is shown that the predictions of this model agree with the available observations.']"

The Eight Year Study was an experiment on the secondary school level--probably the most extensive ever--which commenced in 1932. The study, directed by the Commission on the Relation of School and College, involved the nation\'s major colleges and secondary schools, both public and private. The colleges agreed to suspend their normal admissions requirements for applicants from a limited number of secondary schools thereby allowing the thirty secondary schools to experiment freely with their currícula. The experimentation was carried out during the next eight years. During this period a majority of students participating in the study were evaluated with respect to their college performance. In the first chapter the historical context of the Eight Year Study is examined with reference to the question of what set of historical circumstances converged in the late 1920\'s and 1930\'s to give rise to the Eight Year Study and shape its development. It is shown that the origins and development of the Eight Year Study can be understood in relation to three central ideological strands running through the progressive education movement. The Study began as an upward thrust il of the child-centered pedagogy of the 1930\'s. Leaders of the Eight Year Study sought to achieve on the secondary school level what had been achieved during the 1920\'s in a small number of primary schools. The development of the Eight Year Study in the 1930\'s was shaped by the social reformist emphasis of progressive education and by the empiricst strand of the movement. The social reformist strand shifted curriculum reform from the concern of the child-centered pedagogues with generating greater student interest to the context of strengthening democratic society. The empiricst strand led to a structuring of the study as a controlled scientific inquiry. Although scientific method was often applied to the schools to bring about greater efficiency and standardization in their operation, it was used in the Eight Year Study to buttress the argument for greater diversity and greater responsiveness to student interest. The second chapter encompasses a summary of the Eight Year Study and its findings. The Study clearly demonstrated that students going through non-conventional programs did as woll or better in college than their matched counterparts who studied within conventional curricula. iii In the third chapter it is shown that the Eight Year Study had little sustained impact and the question is broached as to why, in spite of the clarity of its conclusions, the impact of the study was so limited. Suggested explanations are the lack of follow-up support subsequent to the study\'s completion; the outbreak of a world war which diverted the nation\'s attention, and most importantly a post-war climate hostile to progressive educational reform. The fourth chapter includes a critical assessment of the Eight Year ""tudy and an analysis of the limits of curriculum reform such as that undertaken in the Eight Year Study. It is suggested that the Eight Year Study can still serve as a model for reformers seeking to improve the quality of life in the schools, but that it is an inadequate model for those seeking to address the problem of student alienation. It is argued that this latter problem is religious in nature and can only be addressed through a revitalization of religious myth.']"

The Markowitz/Sharpe technique was applied uniformly to fixed- income and equity securities in constructing efficient portfolios based on total expected returns over a one-month forecasting horizon. The security sample included: twenty-two U.S. Treasury, industrial and utility bonds covering a wide range of maturities, coupons, and quality levels; and sixty-six common stocks that frequently appear in institutional portfolios. Market related, diversifiable security risk was isolated by calculating the regression coefficients relating each security\'s returns to market indexes for five-year U.S. Treasury bonds, Aa-utility bonds, a nd the Standard and Poor\'s index of 425 common stocks for the period July 1962 through June 1970. Whereas the patterns of ""market sensitivity"" coefficients for bonds were consistent with general per- ceptions of bond behavior and were insensitive to stock market changes, the returns on many common stocks were significantly related to changes in the bond markets as well as the stock market. The stocks which exhibit strong bond-like behavior could not be readily identified by their utility or non-utility classification suggesting that the single- index models commonly found in the literature overlook the important affect of interest rate changes on common stock returns. Using the market sensitivity coefficients, the risk and return characteristics of each security were calculated and used in forming efficient sets of portfolios for a wide range of market forecasts. For all market conditions, the proportion of total investments held in bonds diminished with increasing portfolio risk but was typically greater than 50 percent even at high risk levels. Most of the bonds in the efficient portfolios were of very short maturity and served the lever- aging function of a riskless asset; to that extent they were not a part of the actively managed portfolio. Bonds, however, also played a substantial role in the manageable, risky asset portion of the portfolio. In comparison to the bullish stock market forecast which made equity securities the dominant investment, the corresponding, equally likely forecast for the bond markets produced efficient portfolios dominated by ""risky"" bonds, a consequence that was even more strong in the latter half of the sample period. The principal conclusion of the study was that fixed-income and equity securities play essentially equal portfolio roles as risky assets when both are evaluated on a market value accounting system against the objective of maximizing total portfolio return.']"

It will be of particular value to those who anticipate establishing such programs on college campuses. It is important for educators to become more aware of the role schools and colleges play in perpetuating and reenforcing violence, especially military, in our society. It is also important for educators to reexamine the role of education and its potential for providing peaceful alternative solutions to our world and domestic problems. While other institutions in our society condone and encourage violence in subtle ways, our educational institutions play a direct role through their articulation of the centrality of that violence which permeates the fabric of society. This study is addressed to higher education programs devoted to develop- ing that body of knowledge relevant to the understanding and teaching of nonviolent and peaceful alternatives to human problems. Some United States colleges and universities have responded by establishing Peace Studies Programs on their campuses. While some have begun to offer a few courses, others have set up degree-granting programs. A small but significant number of intellectuals have tackled the problems involved in developing -2- ""a pedagogy for peace. Meanwhile, universities are witnessing a rapid proliferation of these programs. This phenomenon has given rise to several important academic questions which were explored in this study. The programs which have been selected for this study have in common a teaching orientation as opposed to a focus primarily on research or action, but they differ notably in genesis. The program at Syracuse grew out of student demands; that at Colgate was a result of student, faculty, and administrative direction: while that at Manhattan was primarily the product of a faculty group. These different generative stimuli led to different curricula development, teaching methods, and administrative problems. This dissertation draws upon two types of information. The first consists of three case studies of peace studies programs in institutions of higher learning: Syracuse University, Colgate College, and Manhattan College. Each program is described from materials and information gained through extensive interviews and from written materials which describe and which were developed for each program. An inductive approach allows the development of three distinguishable models flowing from the case studies. Following the development of these models, they are analyzed not only against each other, but more importantly, by using the writer\'s personal experience from some fifteen years of activity in the civil rights and peace movement. Also included is reference material in the form of course descriptions, peace studies proposals and organizations involved in the development of peace studies. The writer has developed a draft on the theory of ""Non- violence on the Interpersonal Level in Extreme Situations."" This material appears in the appendices. -3- The three models which grew out of this study are the following: (1) The student protest model (Syracuse University) ; (2) the Faculty developmental model (Manhattan College) ; (3) The faculty, student and administration collaborative model (Colgate University)']"

The stereochemical re- sults of these studies are discussed in terms of steric approach control, torsional strain, compression effect, and change in conformation of the ketone. The stereochemistry of reduction of complex aluminohydrides is shown to be dependent on the nature of the cation. Comparison of LiAlH4 and LiBH4 as reducing agents towards ketones shows LiBH4 to be less sensitive to steric interactions. Reduction of 2-methylcyclo- hexanone with C1MgAlH^ and Mg(A1H4)2 gave results best ex- plained by assuming complexation of the carbonyl oxygen by magnesium followed by a change in the conformation of the ketone (methyl group equatorial to axial). Results obtained from reduction studies of substituted cyclopentanones and cis-2-methyl-4-tert-butylcyclohexanone do not suggest the presence of a compression effect in metal hydride reductions.

The stereochemistry of reduction of ketones by LiAlHu and LiAlDu is similar. PART II KINETICS OF COMPLEX METAL HYDRIDE REDUCTIONS OF KETONES Pseudo first order kinetic studies on the reaction of LiAlHu, NaAlHA and LiAlDu with mesityl phenyl ketone have been carried out in tetrahydrofuran at 25°. The reac- tions were carried out in excess hydride and found to be first order in hydride and first order in ketone. LiAlH4 is about ten times more reactive than NaAlHy which indicates the importance of the cation in the mechanism of the reac- tion. A deuterium kinetic isotope study involving the reac- tion of LiAlH4 and LiA1D4 with mesityl phenyl ketone gave a value of Ky/KD of 1.27 which implicates the transfer of the hydride from aluminum to the carbonyl carbon in the rate de- termining step of the reaction.

The mixture field equations were obtained by means of a statistical average procedure applied to the two phases. Further- more, by integrating the above mixture field equations over a cross sec- tional area, a one-dimensional mathematical model was developed. The dynamic response of the system to inlet flow perturbations has been derived from the above model; thus obtaining the characteristic equation which predicts the onset of instabilities. Similarity groups which characterize the phenomenon were derived and discussed. The characteristic equation has been solved by computers, and stability maps in appropriate parametric domain have been obtained. It has been found that the Stability Plane, i.e., Subcooling-Phase Change number plane, is best suited for analyzing the problem. The effects of various param- eters, such as the heat flux, subcooling, pressure, inlet velocity, inlet orificing, and exit orificing, on the stability boundary have been ana- lyzed. Particular attention was directed to the effects of 1) the rela- tive velocity between the phases, 2) the nonuniform heat flux profile, and 3) the static and dynamic influences of various friction factor models. In addition to numerical solutions, some simple stability criteria under particular conditions have been obtained.

353,,"weser, don benton",ph.d.,organic chemistry,the kinetics and mechanism of nucleophilic substitution on 9-substituted-6-chloropurines,georgia institute of technology,1971,"['xi i SUMMARY The research described herein is a mechanistic study of the effects of additives on the reaction of piperidine with 6-chloro-9-ethylpurine in isooctane. The investigation was accomplished by means of kinetic and product analysis. Piperidine as well as certain additives were found to catalyze the reaction. A plot of the second order rate coefficient (kobs) obtained from pseudo first order kinetic data against the concentration of piper- idine was found to increase linearly with increasing piperidine concen- tration; however, at higher concentrations of amine the increase was not linear and a smooth curve was obtained. This phenomena is characteristic of the multi-step, addition-elimination mechanism originally proposed by Bunnett and co-workers for the reactions of amines with 2,4-dinitro- halobenzenes in protic media. An isotopic study involving piperidine (-N-h and -N-d) was under- taken. It was demonstrated that piperidine-N-d reacted slightly faster than piperidine-N-h with the purine in isooctane at 29.75°C; however, at 49.5 °C an unusual effect was observed. Initially, the deuterium-labeled compound reacted faster, but at higher concentrations of amine the lines crossed and a kg/kg > 1 was obtained. Vapor pressure studies of piperidine in isooctane indicated that piperidine was not appreciably associated in the concentration range under investigation.

All catalytic coefficients (ky\') were obtained from the slope of the plot of kobs against the concentration of additive. Triethylamine and 2,6-dimethyl- piperidine did not catalyze the reaction, nor did tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran or acetone. Steric hindrance could prevent the amines from accelerating the piperidine-purine reaction; however, failure of a catalytic effect by the ethers and ketone seemed to indicate that simple base catalysis was not operating. Pyridine produced a weak catalytic effect, but 1-aminobutane and ,2-ethanediamine gave a catalytic constant (ky\') comparable to that obtained from the piperidine studies at that temperature. The addition of the lactam 2-azacyclononanone to the reaction solu- tion produced a very large rate enhancement. This was attributed to the possibility that the amide could act as a bifunctional catalyst without high accumulation of charge in the transition state. C.

This effect was attributed to hydrogen bonding of the alcohol and amine components. The data was treated by assuming that the alcohol existed as a dimer which then associated with monomeric amine molecules to produce a trimeric species with = Using the data corrected for association, the plot of k versus the obs catalyst concentration was then linear. A few points at higher concen- trations of amine and alcohol deviated from the linear plot. This was attributed to either more extensive association of the components or a situation where k-1 was approximating k2 + k3 (B) in the multi-step reaction. Finally, a linear Hammett plot was constructed from the catalytic coefficients of a series of meta and pera substituted benzyl alcohols in an attempt to determine the relative importance of basic, acidic or bi- functional catalysis on the reaction. The catalysis coefficients were determined by first assuming no association of the components, and then by assuming alcohol dimer interacting with monomeric amine to produce the trimer (Keg=5). The rho values obtained were + 0.22 (assuming no association) and + 0.26 (assuming association of the components) . The low values for rho appeared to indicate that the acidic portion of the alcohol was only of slightly more importance than the basic portion in these reactions. Thus, based on the information determined herein, the reaction of piperidine with 6-chloro-9-ethylpurine in isooctane appears to go through a multi-step, addition-elimination mechanism such as the following: Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

354,,"mckelvey, john murray, jr.",ph.d.,organic chemistry,kinetics of iodination of methyl substituted benzenes,georgia institute of technology,1971,"['viii SUMMARY The kinetics of the iodination of benzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, prehnitene, mesitylene, and bentamethylbenzene in aqueous solution have been studied as a function of the concentration of iodine, iodide ion, and hydrocarbon. A major purpose of this research was to elucidate the kinetic be- havior of mesitylene in the presence of silver ion. Previous studies near 10-6 M iodide ion concentration in the absence of silver ion indi- cated the following mechanism k + I- H,OI* + ArH k3 ArHI + + H20 k-3 ArHI+ + H20 kg ArI + H30+ The previous studies also showed the rate law = dt (I"") where k*I = + kB The expression for k*I was derived from the application of the steady Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The use of silver ion to lower the iodide ion concentration both accelerates the reaction and makes questionable the above inequality in- volving k-1 (I). The above rate law, in view of the expected attainment of the silver iodide equilibrium Ksp = may be rewritten as: - -d[i2] dt = (ArH) (Ag+) For mesitylene, m-xylene, and anisole it was found that the numerical value of k*I was dependent on the concentration of the above three reac- tants. From the kinetic results it is suggested that the more important source of H,01+ in the presence of silver ion is via the processes: K = (A8I2 (Ag4 (I2) + + The experimental data are consistent with the results of the steady Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

This gives k*I 1 = + (ArH) + k2 K (Agt) This expression predicts the observed inverse dependence of k*I on the hydrocarbon concentration at constant silver ion concentration. The second term in this expression is required because k_1 (I) may be approxi- mately equal to k3 (ArH) at high concentrations of the more reactive hydro- carbons used herein. This term also requires that k*I decrease with re- spect to silver ion concentration but in fact the opposite effect was ob- served, which requires that the term becomes (ArH) A negative activation energy has been found for k2K. The small decrease in k*I with silver ion concentration is due to the decreased fraction of silver ion complexed with silver iodide as AgI2+. An increase of k*I with iodine concentration was found and is due to the increase of k_1 (I"") with respect to k3 (ArH) . Through the principle of microscopic reversibility and on the as- + sumption that the hydrolysis of AgI2 is at equilibrium, it may be shown that K*I = + = + Rate constants may then be compared both in the presence (first term) and Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The presence of silver ion does not affect the isotope effect when k*I is independent of the reactant concentrations. Over the iodide ion concentration range from 10-11 M to 10-4 M the isotope effect is ca. 2.3 for mesitylene. The second purpose of this research was to study the overall effect of structure upon the reactivity of methyl substituted benzene molecules + toward The reactivity was found to parallel that for other elec- trophilic substitution reactions such as chlorination, bromination, iodi- nation by AcOI, and oxygenation by o(\'P). The reaction of H,OI* with a methyl substituted hydrocarbon is characterized by a primary isotope of 2.3 which is increased to 2.9 when steric hindrance is apparent at the reaction center. Where the isotope effect is approximately constant, then the relative reactivity is due solely to the relative rate of attack of H,01* on the hydrocarbon. The 106 fold range of relative reactivities of the methyl substi- tuted benzene derivatives is readily estimated from relative energies of the respective proton complexes as obtained from CNDO/2 molecular orbital calculations. These calculations give a good account of the stabilization of the transition state by the participation of the methyl group through hyperconjugation. Water has been found to be a suitable solvent in which nonpolar hydrocarbons may be studied. As water allows some characterization of the ionic inorganic chemistry involved, more understanding of the organic por- - tion is available.

355,,"yoon, yo kil",ph.d.,chemical engineering,gas-liquid phase equilibria in the helium - carbon-tetrafluoride and helium - chlorotrifluoromethane systems at low temperatures and 20-120 atmospheres,georgia institute of technology,1971,"[""SUMMARY The object of this work is to determine the experi- mental gas-liquid phase equilibria in pressurized, binary systems at low temperatures and compare these values with theoretically predicted data. The systems studied are the helium-carbon tetrafluoride and elium-chlorotrifluoromethan in which the condensed component is below its critical tem- perature and the gaseous component (helium) is well above its critical temperature. For the determination of the gas and liquid phase compositions, a single-pass, continuous flow type, equili- 68 brium apparatus previously described by Kirk and Kirk and ziegler69 was used together with two gas chromatographs. 90,91, Later, this same apparatus was also used by Mullins, Liu, 77 and Garber 37 for their phase equilibrium studies in binary systems. The gas and liquid phase equilibrium compositions in the helium-carbon tetrafluoride system were measured at six temperatures, 106.01, 117.33, 132.18, 147.10, 162.03 and 173.02 K and pressures from 20 to 120 atmospheres with an interval of 20 atmospheres. In the helium-chlorotrifluoro- methane system, seven isotherms of 145.21, 163.01, 180.02, 196.01, 211.06, 221.27, and 231.08 K were studied in the gas-liquid region. The gas and liquid phase compositions xx i were determined at six pressure points, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 atmospheres along each isotherm. The gas phase ana- lysis in the helium-carbon tetrafluoride system is estimated to be accurate to 2 mole percent of carbon tetrafluoride and in the helium-chlorotrifluoromethane system to +3.5 mole percent of lorotrifluoromethane. The uncertainty of liquid phase measurements in these two systems is estimated to be 2 mole percent of helium. These uncertainties were deter- mined by considering the uncertainties of the temperature measurement (+0.03 K), the pressure gauge (0.5 percent) , and the chromatograph calibration curve. Since no experimental phase equilibrium data for these systems were available in the literature, no comparison could be made for the experimental phase equilibrium data obtained in this work. The gas phase equilibria for these systems were described in terms of the enhancement factor, Ø = Py1/ Po1 An exact thermodynamic expression for the enhancement factor was derived. For the evaluation of this expression, an assumption of ideal solution for liquid phase was made and the virial equation of state truncated after the third virial coefficient and Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation of state were used to describe the gas phase P-V-T properties for the helium-carbon tetrafluoride system. For the helium-chlorotri- fluoromethane system, evaluation was restricted to the virial equation of state. The pure and interaction second virial coefficients of the virial equation of state were calculated utilizing the Lennard-Jones potential (classical), Kihara core poten- tial, and Kihara core potential with the correction factor, <12,51 for the geometric mixing rule. The Lennard-Jones 18 potential (classical) and the method of Chueh and Prausnitz were used for the prediction of the third virial coefficients. Both the Lorentz and linear averages were considered in this work for the evaluation of (Bo) 1 2 in the Benedict-Webb-Rubin - equation of state. The various theoretical models based on what has been described above were tested for the prediction of the en- hancement factors. The predicted enhancement factors were compared with those experimentally determined for the helium binary systems of this work. The KIHEK12 model which uti- lizes the Kihara core potential with the experimentally 18 determined K12 and the method of Chueh and Prausnitz for the calculation of second and third virial coefficients, respectively, predicted the best enhancement factors. The Lennard-Jones classical model also predicted the enhancement factors which are in quite satisfactory agreement with the experimental values except at the highest temperatures. Con- trary to expectation, 8,37,90 the Benedict-Webb-Rubir equa- tion of state, with (Bo), based on the Lorentz average, generally gave better results than that based on the linear average. From the phase equilibrium data obtained here, also xxiii extracted are the interaction second virial coefficients. The same theoretical models as used for the prediction of enhancement factors were also used for the prediction of B 1 2 values. These predicted 812 values were compared with those experimentally determined It was found that the discre- pancy between the theoretically predicted and experimentally determined B12 values was principally responsible for the incorrect enhancement factors predicted from the various theoretical models. These theoretical models all failed to predict the satisfactory 11/2 values for the helium-carbor tetrafluoride system in the temperature range of 303 K to 773 K, where experimental B12 values were determined by 59 Kalfoglou and Miller. Since the B12 values predicted from the Kihara core potential differs greatly from the experimental B12 values for the systems of this work, the Kihara core potential was used in conjunction with K12 to predict B12 values. This K12 factor is used to correct the geometric mixing rule for the energy parameter and has been employed by recent investi- 18,19,33,50,51,77,90 gators. The K12 value was determined simutaneously with the 312 values from the phase equilibrium data obtained in this work. The value of K12 thus determined (0.06 for the helium-carbon tetrafluoride system and 0.25 for the helium-chlorotrifluoromethane system) was compared with that calculated using the correlation given by Hiza and Duncan51 (0.28 and 0.37 for the helium-carbon tetrafluoride and helium-chlorotrifluoromethane system, respectively) . Unlike other helium binary systems, 37,50,126 these two values differ considerably from each other, which resulted in large discrepancy between the B12 values predicted from the KIHEK12 model and KIHCK12 model which uses the calculated 51 K12 value from the correlation of Hiza and Duncan instead of experimental K12 value and also the predicted enhancement factors from these two models, To determine the Henry's law constant, H2, and the partial molar volume at infinite dilution, V2, for helium from the experimental phase equilibrium data, the Krichevsky- 73 Kasarnovsky equation was used. This equation is based on the assumptions that the liquid solution is ideal and the change of V 2 with pressure is negligible and enables one to evaluate the H2 and V2 values using the liquid composition and the fugacity of the gas phase. In this work, the fuga- city of helium in the gas phase was evaluated using the virial equation of state. For the theoretical prediction of H20 and V20 values, 125 the method of Snider and Herrington based on the hard sphere model of fluids has been used. The H20 and V2 values predicted using this method were compared with the experimen- tal values and the agreement was found to be at most within 55 percent of the experimental values. Although in the 125, application of this method Snider and Herrington and 127 Staveley did not comment on the temperature dependency of the parameter, a12, which is a measure of background potential, a slight temperature dependency of this para- meter has been found in this work.""]"
356,,"kocamustafaogullari, gunol",ph.d.,mechanical engineering,thermo-fluid dynamics of separated two-phase flow,georgia institute of technology,1971,"['xix SUMMARY The overall objectives of this dissertation are two-fold. First, to provide a general thermo-fluid dynamic formulation of separated two- phase flow, and second, to use this formulation for analyzing various dynamic aspects of the film flow regime. Consequently, the thesis is divided into two parts. In Part I, the conservation equations which are expressed both in terms of the two-fluid model and of the diffusional, i.e., drift, model are derived. These equations, derived from the space averaging procedure, take into account the effects of surface phenome - ich as surface ten- sion and surface shear and of surface processes such as momentum, heat and mass transfer at the interface. Finally these conservation equa- tions are used to establish the similarity groups appropriate to separated flows. In Part II, the two-fluid model formulation of Part I, is used to develop a stability theory of separated plane flows. The analysis takes into account the effects of surface tension and liquid viscosity, of mass and heat transfer at the interface as well as the dynamic effects of the vapor on the liquid film. The most unstable growth factor, de- rived from the analysis, is used to calculate the onset of liquid entrain- ment and of flow plugging. The results show that evaporation has a destabilizing effect on liquid films whereas it stabilizes vapor films, i.e., it has a destabilizing effect on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

358,,"abidaud, alvaro",ph.d.,organic chemistry,kinetic study on the nucleophilic substitution of purines,georgia institute of technology,1971,"[""ix SUMMARY The research described herein is an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of the nucleophilic aromatic substitution by piperidine, in particular, on 6-chloro-9-methoxymethylpurine. The work was divided in two broad areas: (1) solvent effects on the reaction rate constant and (2) the direct observation of an addition (Meisenheimer) complex by means of n.m.r. and 1.V. spectroscopy. The reaction of piperidine with 6-chloro-9-methoxymethy lpurine in non-polar, aprotic solvents, such as cyclohexane and benzene, was found to be catalyzed by piperidine. A plot of the second order rate co- efficient (kobs', obtained from pseudo-first order kinetic data, against the concentration of piperidine was found to increase linearly with increasing piperidine concentration; however, at higher concentrations of the amine the increase was not linear and a smooth curve was obtained. This phenomenon is characteristic of the multi-step, addition-elimination mechanism originally proposed by Bunnett and co-workers for the reaction of amines with 2,4-dinitrohalobenzenes in protic media. An isotopic study involving piperidine-N-h and -N-d was under- taken. It was demonstrated that piperidine-N-d reacted slightly faster than piperidine-N-h with the purine, in benzene and cyclohexane, at all temperatures studied. The KH/KD was about 0.90+0.03. In the solvent 1,4-dioxane, at 23.0°C, there is a slight catalysis of piperidine, but at 32.0°C and 44.5°C the catalytic effect of the amine is no longer observed Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. Piperidine-N-d reacted slightly faster than piperidine-N-h at 23.0°C, = At 32.0° and 44.5°C there is no ob- servable kinetic isotope effect as indicated by the value of XH/KD = 1.01 + 0.03. At 23.0°C, in 1,4-dioxane, K1H/K1 (the ratio of the rate constant 1D for the initial attack of piperidine on the purine) is equal to 0.92 + 0.03. This difference is attributed to the slightly larger nucleophili- city of piperidine-N-d compared to piperidine-N-h. This is the first case in which this phenomenon is observed. In polar solvents, such as water, 60 percent 1,4-dioxane - 40 percent water (v/v), dimethy1 sulfoxide and methanol), there is no catalysis by piperidine, i.e., Kobs is independent of the concentration of the amine. These solvents help decompose the intermediate complex by assisting in the removal of HC1 from it. Also, the high dielectric of these media accelerate the rate of reaction. Finally, the direct observation of an addition (Meisenheimer com- plex) using 6-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-9-methoxymethylpurir and 6-methoxy-9- methoxymethylpurine was accomplished by using n.m.r. and u.v. spectroscopy. .

360,,"lores, manuel edward",ph.d.,aerospace materials,a theoretical study of nonlinear longitudinal combustion instability in liquid propellant rocket engines,georgia institute of technology,1972,"[""xi SUMMARY Nonlinear analyses of the stability of moderate and large ampli- - tude high frequency longitudinal combustion-driver oscillations in liquid propellant rocket motors are presented. The objective of these investi- gations is to provide rocket design engineers with straight forward analytical techniques for the nonlinear analysis of longitudinal combustion instability. The resulting methodology (1) provides physical insight into the phenomenon of longitudinal combustion instability, (2) clarifies cer- tain ambiguities in previous investigations of the problem, and (3) requires a minimum of mathematical computations. It is believed that the technique s developed in this dissertation can also be used to investigate axial mode combustion instability problems in solid propellant rocket motors and air-breathing propulsion devices. The mathematical techniques are developed by investigating the nonlinear behavior of axial mode combustion instability oscillations in liquid propellant rocket motors having a high impedance injector and a short nozzle. The mean flow Mach number is assumed to be small. The combustion process is distributed throughout the combustor, and it is assumed to be completed at the nozzle entrance. Crocco's time lag hypo- thesis is used to represent the unsteady combustion process. The undetermined function version of the Galerkin method is used to find solutions. This approach considers the stability of a number of modes simultaneously, and it yields both the transient and final periodic behavior of the combustion instability oscillations. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. xii The salient results of this investigation are summarized in the following paragraphs: 1. Instability of a mode cannot be triggered at engine operating conditions under which another mode is linearly unstable. 2. For moderate amplitude instabilities, the regime of unstable engine operating conditions, in the A - to plane, can be predicted by a linear analysis. 3. For most unstable engine operating conditions the flow oscil- lations exhibit a shock-type behavior with the number of shocks determined by the characteristics of the engine operating conditions. 4. When only a single mode is linearly unstable, the resulting nonlinear waveforms depend upon the proximity of the engine operating con- ditions to resonance. Based on this dependence of the nonlinear waveforms upon engine operating conditions, a correlation technique is developed which permits the analytical solutions to be related to experimental data. 5. In a majority of cases, the nonlinear behavior of unstable engines can be approximated by second order solution 6. Increasing the mean flow Mach number is destabilizing. 7. Increasing the combustor length is stabilizing for above reso- nant conditions, and destabilizing for below resonant conditions. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

361,,"sanchez, joseph peter",ph.d.,organic chemistry,the photochemistry of azafulvenes,georgia institute of technology,1972,"['vii SUMMARY Although several aza- and diazafulvenes have been prepared, there has been no reported attempt to prepare triazafulvenes or diazaful- venes containing two adjacent nitrogen atoms. These would be of great interest since the photochemical expulsion of nitrogen from them would afford azatriafulvenes and triafulvenes respectively. An approach reported for the synthesis of the heterocyclic vari- ant of cyclopropenone, azirinone, via the decomposition of a-azidopheny1- ketene at -30° gave only carbon monoxide and benzoitrile. It is amusing to speculate that an analogous reaction with a- azidoallene might provide evidence for the presence of an equally inter- esting azatriafulvene. Since the photochemical expulsion of nitrogen from di- and triazafulvenes seemed to offer a more expeditious route to triafulvenes and azatriafulvenes, our research consisted of: (1) the preparation of suitable precursors; (2) the reaction to produce the corresponding azafulvenes; and (3) isolation and identification of the products from the subsequent photoreactions. A series of pyrazole and triazole diphenylcarbinols and their chloro hydrochlorides has been prepared, These were converted by de- hydrohalogenation with triethylamine to di- and triazafulvenes which were identified by isolation of the fulvene itself, its dimer or addi- tion products with methanol and amines. Irradiation of the triazafulvenes XXVII, XXXVI and XLII gave rise to a mixture of products which were isolated by column chromatography Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. viii and identified by physical and spectral comparison with authentic samples. The isolation of triphenylacrylonitrile (LXXXI) from the irrad- iation of XXXVI indicates the presence of a triphenylazatriafulvene (LXXVI) intermediate, There is also evidence for the formation of an intermediate tri- phenylazete (LXXVII) from which both 2, ,3-diphenylquinoline (LXX) and the proposed 1,5-diazocine (XXIX) arise during photolysis of either XXXVI or XXVIII. The photoreaction of XLII produced the dichloro analog of XXIX (XLIII), from which a complete X-ray crystallographic analysis will hopefully confirm the assigned structure.

The photochemical behavior of compounds having a five-membered B ring fused to the chromophore was particularly of interest. The bicyclic 6/5-fused cyclohexadienones28a, 28b and 1, 4a- dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2(4aH)naphthalenone 3b have been prepared and irradiated at 2537 A in dry dioxane. The major product in each case was the corresponding bicyclo [3 .1.0]hex-3-en-2-one 29a, 29b, and 4b together with some small amounts of linearly conjugated dienones 30a and 30b. Prolonged irradiation of these lumiproducts with light of wavelengths greater than 3000 Date in both dioxane and ethanol gave pre- - dominantly the starting cross-conjugated cyclohexadienones 28a and 28b , presumably via a bipolar mechanism. The bicyclo [3.1.0]hex-3-en-2-one 28b which has similar substitution to lumisantonin was irradiated with a 450-watt high pressure mercury lamp with a Pyrex filter in both dioxane and ethanol. In the former solvent it gave mainly the homo- annular dienone 32b, while the latter it afforded the 5/6-fused ethoxy ketone 33. The homoannular dienone reacted photochemically with ethanol to provide the dienone ester 34 which was isomerized photochemically or thermally into its cis- - and trans- conjugated esters, 35 and 36 . The 4-methoxy-7a-methyl-, and 4-methoxy-7a-isopropyl-5(7aH) - indanones were also synthesized and irradiated. Similar results of form- Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

From a mechanistic point of view, the formation of the tricyclic methoxy ketone 42 from the photochemical reaction of the unsubstituted dienone 28a in methanol or 45 percent acetic-methanol was particularly interesting. In order to elucidate the stereochemistry of the tricyclic compound 42, it was treated with lithium-liquid ammonia followed by sodium hydride to a product assigned the structure 45. On irradiation compound 7a-carboethoxy-5(7aH) -indanone provides mainly one product, 7-carboethoxy-5,6-dihydro-2(4H)-indanone, whether the photoreaction was carried out in nucleophilic solvent (such as ethanol and aqueous-acet: acid) or non-nucleophilic media(such as dioxane and e.ther) .

363,,"little, william campbell",ph.d.,mechanical engineering,the role of sediment gradation on channel armoring,georgia institute of technology,1972,"['xii SUMMARY The objective of this study was to systematically investigate the effects of sediment gradation on channel armoring. The primary variable was gradation of the sediment material. A geometric mean diameter of 1.00 millimeter was used for all sediments with geometric standard devi- ations, ogo, of 1.12, 1.50, 2.00, 2.50, and 3.00. These mixtures of crushed quartz were placed in a recirculating flume with a sediment bed 1.97 feet wide, 40.0 feet long, and approximately 0.15 foot deep. Arbi- trarily selected flows, to purposely induce armoring, were kept constant throughout each experiment. Bed slope was initially set at 0.002. Depth of flow was held constant throughout each experimental run by a sluice gate. The armoring process was considered to be stable when the final sediment transport rate was not more than one percent of the initial transport rate. The surface layer of particles was then removed by the wax method and the distribution of the armored particles determined. An empirical equation was developed through dimensional analysis relating the sediment properties of the original and armored distri- butions to the flow properties, when the sediment bed had become stable because of the armoring process. The equation is 0.353 0.908 (1) v(s)1)8 where geometric mean diameters of the armored and orig- inal sediment mixtures, respectively, °go is the geometric standard xiii deviation of the original sediment mixture, ut is the bed shear velocity defined by u* = (RRS where g is the acceleration of gravity, R is the hydraulic radius and S is the slope of the energy grade line, V is the kinematic viscosity of the water, and S is the specific gravity of the sediment (2.65). From the equation, for the given flow conditions and original sediment properties in a channel, the geometric mean diameter of the armored material, dga> can be calculated. The armored diameter calculated from this equation is applicable only if the channel would armor. Another criterion was developed to determine, for the given sedi- ment and flow properties, if the sediment bed could armor. If the cal- culated geometric mean diameter of the armored surface material was between the dos and d95 (that size for which 5 and 95 percent, respec- tively, by weight is finer) size of the original material, the original bed material would armor for those flow conditions. With the broadly graded materials, ago in 2.00, where channel armoring occurred, the bed degraded uniformly in depth along the length of the bed. However, for uniform materials, \' go < 1.50, little or no armoring could be induced, and the bed did not degrade uniformly in depth but degraded more at the beginning of the reach and less at the outlet end resulting in a reduced bed slope. Dunes formed initially and as they moved off, armoring was immedi- ately observable. Armoring of the surface had no significant change on the average bed shear stress throughout the armoring process. After an ""armor coat"" had developed, a very low sediment transport rate continued for long periods of time. This transport was by local xiv scour of fine material around larger particles. Fine material could be observed ""hiding"" in the wake or zone of separation of the large par- ticles. Turbulence caused shifting of the zone of separation and spo- radic movement of fine material. The results of this study were compared with the calculated armored distributions by a method developed by Gessler. The geometric mean diameters calculated by Gessler\'s method were consistently lower than the measured values of this study and differed from 3.5 to 29.0 per- cent with an average difference of approximately 20 percent.']"

There remain certain aspects of the neutron thermalization problem which are not completely understood. Fundamental questions have arisen concerning the treatment of the neutron field and the establishment of an equilibrium, asymptotic decay mode in the pulsed-source-time-dependent and steady-state-space-dependent diffu- sion parameter experiments in very small or highly poisoned crystalline moderating systems. Specifically, theory predicts the disappearance of the discrete fundamental mode eigenvalues (decay constants) and eigen- functions (equilibrium spectra) in systems with bucklings or poisonings above some ""critical"" value so that the decay in this region is non- asymptotic even at long times after or at large distances from the source, being governed by some non time- or space-energy separable continuum dis- tribution of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. It is the intent of this thesis to undertake direct experimental verification of the disappearance of the discrete fundamental mode decay and the concurrent existence of the continuum range of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in the diffusion length problem in small, steady-state crystalline systems with strong transverse leakage effects.

The spectra for neutrons moving away from the source were characterized by a progressive build-up of cold neutrons, below the Bragg cut-off, with increasing distance from the source plane; the rela- tive rate of cold neutron build-up increasing with increasing transverse buckling (decreasing transverse dimensions). In both assemblies, the angular spectrum was found to be strongly space dependent and in neither was there any apparent tendency toward an equilibrium or asymptotic dis- tribution out to distances in excess of 40 cm from the source plane. The strong space dependent behavior means that the usual assumption of space- energy separability in the solution of the transport equation is clearly invalid in this buckling range. Furthermore, the complete lack of equi- librium, asymptotic decay conditions means that the coefficients of the usual fit to the decay constant versus buckling expansion are no longer a unique function of the moderator diffusion parameters. The measured nonequilibrium spatial decay behavior in small beryl- - lium assemblies is in agreement with the published transport theory pre- dictions of the ""critical"" transverse dimensions for the disappearance of the discrete asymptotic decay mode, but in disagreement with the corres- ponding diffusion theory results which predict that asymptotic decay conditions should exist in beryllium assemblies as small as 30 X 30 cm.

In theoretical high frequency combustion instability analyses, the three-dimensional nozzle admittance theory developed by Crocco is used to obtain values of the nozzle admittance although these values have not been checked experimentally. The present investigation was undertaken to experi- mentally determine the admittance of various liquid rocket engine nozzles subjected to three-dimensional oscillations and to compare the experimental results with the theoretical predictions. The theoretical predictions are calculated using Crocco's theory for the nozzles under investigation. The values of the real and imaginary parts of the admittance are tabulated over a range of nondimensional frequencies which includes longitudinal and mixed first tangential-longitudinal modes. To obtain experimental data for comparison with the theoretical predictions, a technique based on the classical impedance tube method is developed. The classical impedance tube theory is extended to account for the presence of a one-dimensional mean flow and three- dimensional oscillations. In this analysis expressions are developed which describe the dependence of the pressure amplitude and phase of the standing wave pattern in the tube upon the spacial coordinates, the magnitude of the mean flow Mach number, and the conditions at the nozzle entrance. By measuring the standing wave pattern, the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Three techniques were developed which can be used to determine the nozzle admittance. Two were eliminated from consideration for the present study because of practical limitations. The technique which is used consists of measuring the pressure amplitude at several predetermined locations along the length of the tube. The numerical technique for determining the admittance from the pressure amplitude measurements is then presented. The experimental facility consists of an aluminum tube 10 feet in length. The nozzles under consideration are mounted at one end and a multi-orifice injector is attached to the other end. To acoustically isolate the system, sonic conditions are maintained across the injector and at the nozzle throat. Two electropneumatic drivers located near the injector are used to generate longitudinal and mixed first tangential-longitudinal waves in the tube. The experimental admittance results are obtained in the form of graphs of the real and imaginary parts of the nozzle admittance versus nondimensional frequency. Data are obtained for nozzles with half-angles of 15, 30, and 45 degrees and entrance Mach numbers of 0.08, 0.16, and 0.20. These data are compared with the theoretical predictions. For longitudinal oscillations, the theoretical and experimental results were in agreement to within experimental error. However, for mixed first .tangential-longitudinal modes., the agreement was satisfactory for entrance Mach numbers 0.16 or above. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

366,,"leach, william marshall, jr.",ph.d.,electrical engineering,probe compensated near-field measurements on a cylinder,georgia institute of technology,1972,"['viii SUMMARY The prediction of the far-field radiation patterns of antennas from measurements made in the near field has been an area of consider- able interest. This research concerns a new method for determining the far-field pattern of an antenna from probe compensated near-field meas- urements over the surface of a right circular cylinder enclosing the antenna. The method is derived by expanding the radiated fields in cylindrical wave expansions and using the Lorentz reciprocity theorem to solve for the field radiated by the antenna from the probe output voltage. It is shown rigorously that the antenna pattern can be deter- mined independently of the characteristics of the measurement probe pro- vided that certain calibration data for the probe are known. A method for determining these data from the measured far field of the probe is described. Since the measurement of the near field of any antenna potentially requires the accumulation of a large amount of data, the problem of spa- tial sampling is of great practical importance. This problem is dis- cussed for the cylindrical measurement surface and lower bounds are established for the axial and polar angle sample intervals on the cylinder. It is specifically assumed that the antenna is not a high-Q or supergain structure. The theory is verified experimentally by calculating the far- field patterns of a test antenna from measured near-field data. The Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The far-field patterns of the test antenna are calculated for each case and compared to the measured far-field patterns of the antenna. The computational process required to evaluate the far-field patterns is complex and requires numerical techniques. Specifically, the calculations are centered around an application of the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm to evaluate the necessary integrals and summations. Detailed descriptions of the methods used in the pattern calculations are given, and an example pattern from the literature is computed to verify them.

Measurements of the diffuse x-ray intensities were made in a minimum volume in reciprocal space fo: the fcc alloy, so that quantitative determination of local-order parameters could be made. The ""size effect"" coefficients for the first and second order displacement effects were separated from those due to local order and their values were determined. The local-order parameters were used for a computer simulation of an average atomic configuration. The atomic model developed for the as-quenched structure which ""fits"" the first five experimental SRO coefficients shows that the local atomic arrangements consist of clusters of molybdenum atoms in the {100} planes. The atoms within the clusters satisy the long-range-ordered structure of N14Mo since there are no Mo-Mo pairs as first neighbors, only one as second neighbors and six or more as third neighbors. The rodlike morphology of the molybdenum clusters grows on ordering for 5 minutes at 650°C. This result corroborates the rodlike morphology present in dilute Ni-W alloys and explains the [100] streaking observed in the diffraction studies.']"

The thesis also reports the devel- opment of a theory to predict the maximum temperature and the shear stress in elastohydrodynamic liquid films. Solutions can be obtained via dimensionless graphs and contain most other lubrication related quantities. Experimental observations are consistent with the theory The purpose of the work is to develop a method to determine the viscous properties of lubricants under elastohydrodynamic operating conditions in a laboratory experiment where the parameters of pressure, temperature and shear stress can be independently varied. The use of a short length capillary has been introduced in order to achieve high shear stress. Reliable entrance and exit corrections for highly viscous capil- lary flow appears to have been found. The upper limit of shear stress attainable in capillary viscometry has been increased approximately 50 times over previously reported values of about 106 dyn/cm² (~14.5 psi). The increased shear stress limit is only 3 - 5 times less than the aver- age shear stress experienced by the fluid during passage of an elastohy- drodynamic contact. A further increase in shear stress limit up to about 1.4 x 108 dyn/cm² (~2 kpsi) appears to be possible. This higher predicted level of shear stress is of the same order of magnitude as the average shear stress to which the fluid is subjected during passage of an xiv elastohydrodynamic contact. The work has shown that unblended synthetic hydrocarbon oils and a silicone oil tested have constant viscosity as function of shear stress in the investigated range, - -700 psi shear stress, when liquid behavior is displayed. The silicone fluid shows solidification at pressure above 50 kpsi and shear stress above about 107 dyn/cm2, at 75°F. The polymer blended mineral oil shows non-liquid behavior at low stress (above about 105 dyn/cm², 1.4 psi). These observations of non-liquid behavior of a silicone oil and a polymer blended mineral oil may possibly provide part of an understanding of the anomalous behavior of these types of lubricants with respect to the ability to create an elastohydrodynamic film. Existing theory for prediction of film thickness assumes implicitly liquid behavior of the lubricants. No discernible time dependent effects were observed for the liquid lubricants. The thesis further deals with application of the viscosity meas- urements to determine liquid film behavior in the high pressure area of a point contact configuration. The purpose of this part of the work is to develop a general theory which will predict the elastohydrodynamic quantities of interest, particularly shear stress and maximum temperature, under physically reasonable assumptions. The theory has been developed to a stage where the shear stress and the maximum attainable temperature each can be determined through a XV few graphical steps on a dimensionless diagram. Other related elasto- hydrodynamic quantities can be derived from the maximum temperature and the shear stress.']"

The experimental adsorption capacities of pure methane, ethane, ethylene, and carbon dioxide gases, obtained in this study, were essen- tially correlated in one single characteristic curve, following a modi- 20,40 fication of the Polanyi-Dubinin Potential theory. This same method, 50,51 when applied to the data of Szepesy and Illes on other gases and on a similar adsorbent, yielded a similar correlation with some scatter at low pressures. 18 The tubinin-Radushkevich equation was found not to represent well the pure gas adsorption data of this study and to contain tempera- ture dependent parameters which make its use impractical. A linear least squares fit of the pure gas adsorption correlation developed here permitted the estimation of pure gas adsorption capacities, at the temperature and pressure conditions of this study, with an average deviation of 6.1% with respect to the experimental values and with certain limitations in the low pressure region. The experimental adsorption capacities of methane-ethane-ethylene binary and ternary gas mixtures obtained in this study were essentially correlated in a single characteristic curve superimposable on the pure gas adsorption correlation, following a modification of the method pro- 25 posed by Grant and Manes. It was found that the equipotential concept, basic to this model, does not hold at 301.4 K.

In the experimental part, i.e., the first part, of the thesis the onset of thermally induced flow oscillations in a uniformly heated boiling channel has been presented. This consists of a brief description of the design, construction, and instrumentation of the boiling loop, which is followed by the procedure used in obtaining the data on the onset of flow oscillation and the pre- sentation of the experimental results. In the second part of the thesis, a theoretical analysis including the effect of thermal non-equilibrium has been carried out. A new general correlation for determining the point of net vapor generation in a boiling channel with inlet subcooling has been found. It has been discovered that, for low mass flow rates (Pe < 70,000) the point of net vapor generation is governed by the local thermal condition, whereas for high mass flow rates (Pe > 70,000) this point is controlled by hydrodynamic condition. A constitutive equation for the rate of vapor generation in the thermal non-equilibrium region has been derived from the steady state energy consideration. This equation, together with the new correlation for the point of net vapor generation has been successfully used to predict the vapor void fraction in various boiling channels.

The system stability boundary in the subcooling number versus equilibrium phase change number plane is then obtained by using the D-partition method. When com- pared with the equilibrium theory, the present non-equilibrium theory pre- dicts a more stable system at low subcooling number and a more unstable system at high subcooling number. Experimental data on the onset and the frequency of oscillation reported in the first part of the thesis show better agreement with the new non-equilibrium model (assuming no change in the local subcooling at the boiling boundary) than with the equilibrium model. A simplified stability criterion, which can be used for preliminary estimation of the system stability boundary, has also been developed for low subcooling number.

It must be emphasized that our algorithm uses nothing but the simplex algorithm and that no elaborate subproblem needs be solved even for constructing a cutting plane, so that it is expected to be a prac- tical algorithm for this class of problems. It will be shown that this algorithm generates an E-optimal solution (and sometimes an optimal solution) in finitely many steps provided the feasible region is bounded. (The proof of finiteness for the case where the feasible region is un- bounded remains as an open question.)

Attention is focused on the well-known sim- plex code conjecture which posits the optimality of the signal set whose vectors are the vertices of a regular n-dimensional simplex. Using geometrically inspired methods, we present a simplified proof of the inequality developed by Landau and Slepian in their 1966 paper. The key elements permitting the simplification are a spherical projection and a lemma which shows that the requirements imposed on the optimum solu- tion can be relaxed. In the course of the exposition the difficulties pre- venting application of the inequality in spaces of dimension greater than three are clarified. Next, a series of conjectures on the properties of the regular sim- plex are proposed. To compare the regular simplex with any other region formed by a collection of n hyperplanes in n-space, we define a function t(r) which is the (n-1)-dimensional measure of the intersection of the shell X = r with each configuration. The first conjecture asserts that the function corresponding to the regular simplex and the function corresponding to the arbitrary region have only one crossing. The second asserts that if the integrals from 0 to to of the two are equal, the simplex function is less than or equal to the other for all r larger than ro. The third assumes that all of the hyperplanes of the competing region and those forming the regular simplex are the same distance from the origin and postulates that the simplex function is in this case less than or equal to the other for all r. We then prove that a sufficient condition for the latter is that, given n-1 points and a shell x = r iii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. in (n-l)-dimensional space, there is at most a unique position for an n-th - point such that the intersection of the shell with the polytope de- fined by the n points has its center of mass at the origin. Returning to the conjecture itself, we formulate and prove a ""linear- ized"" version of the problem. The linearized conjecture is that if the tips of the constrained code vectors are regarded as electrons which repel one another according to a specified force law, the regular simplex is the minimum energy configuration. Finally, we comment on the geometrical in- terpretation of the relation between optimality at low signal-to-noise ratios A and the mean width of the polytope with the signal set as ver- tices. In addition, a search through the literature indicates that a much-cited proof that the regular simplex maximizes the mean width may not exist, and thus optimality as A tends to zero appears to remain an open question. iv Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Two plutonic events occurred in the Precambrian (about 1650 m.y. and 1400 m.y.), and a volcanic event occurred in the middle Tertiary. The Tertiary volcanism started with the extrusion of a thin alkali olivine basalt over an arkosic conglomerate. This was followed by the intrusion and extrusion of a ring of dacite domes (29 m.y.). The early dacites were quartz- poor and were followed by more voluminous ""normal"" dacites. The last phases of dacite volcanism were accompanied by the eruption of the Siphon Draw Member of the Superstition Tuff (24.4 m.y.). . The eruption of this tuff is believed to have been contemporaneous with caldera collapse because of the thick accumulation of tuff within the caldera. The first ash flows of the Geronimo Head Formation were erupted either during the last phases of collapse or shortly thereafter. These ash flows were accompanied by an alkali olivine basalt and were closely followed by the extrusion and intrusion of quartz latite domes and lavas (20 n.y. and 21 m.y.). Resurgence of the quartz latite magma up-domed the central core of the Superstition caldera. A similar volcanic cycle started with the eruption of the Dogie Spring Member of the Superstition Tuff (18.4 m.y.). .

Several smaller cauldrons were formed during this period: The Willow Springs cauldron, the Black Mesa cauldron, and the Florence Junction cauldron. Various episodes of magma resurgence up-lifted the central core of each cauldron and formed domes within the ring fracture zone of the Superstition caldera. Volcanism came to a close between 10 and 15 million years ago. The Canyon Lake Member of the Superstition Tuff (15 m.y.) appears to be the last ash flow and was closely followed by the extrusion of a thin alkali olivine basalt. The final volcanic event appears to have been the emplacement of small rhyolite dikes and domes around the outer margin of the Superstition caldera. Strontium isotope studies indicate that the magma: (s) for the Super- stition volcanics must have been derived below the base of the granitic crust. Both the silicic and mafic volcanics have similar, rela- tively low initial ratios. They may therefore be related to a common source. It is proposed that the magmas were derived by fractional fusion of the lower crust. Once formed, the magmas differentiated independently forming two suites which are discontin- uous with one another but cogenetic. Most of the volcanics started to crystallize at high temperatures and pressures as indicated by the system Q-Or-Ab-H,0 and oxygen isotope geothermometry. The magmas were undersaturated with respect to water. During ascent to the surface the magmas underwent minor crystal-melt re-equilibration and cooled. This cooling was accompanied by the crystallization of biotite. Prior to eruption the upper portions of the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Wirt, Ph.D. Stanford University, 1970 Price and service quality are important variables in the design of optimal service systems. Price is important because of the strong consumption exter- nality inherent in service systems. Quality is important since it directly affects consumer welfare, and is readily controlled by altering the priorities of service offered. This thesis takes a systematic view of this problem, and presents techniques for quantitative determination of the optimal prices and service quality in a wide clase of systems. A probabilistic demand model sensitive to both price and quality is de- rived from the microeconomic concept that a consumer chooses the service which maximizes the difference between willingness-to-pa; and price. This model for the individual's demand is then aggregated to obtain a partial equilibrium macroeconomic model of demand. After constructing the demand model's likelihood function, a Bayesian inference technique is developed for using data to reduce uncertainty about consumer's values. Records of actual consumption--rather than interview data or other indirect data--are used in the calibration procedure. Since only samples of the likelihood function are used, the inference technique is more generally applicable than just to this particular demand model. Another phase of this work develops criteria for optimizing prices and choosing among alternative qualities of service. Due to the stochastic nature of demand and uncertainty about parameters in the demand model, system payoff is necessarily a random variable. It is argued that the optimal rule is to extremize the expected value of system payoff per unit of time. For private decision makers, expected profits are maximized, and for public decision -111- makers, aggregate willingness to pay is maximized. This approach emphasizes that an optimum system can be specified even though there is considerable un- certainty about demand. A final phase of this work applies stochastic approximation to finding optimal prices in service systems. Since only a simulation of system operation is required, the method can be applied to a very wide class of service problems ; the principal limitation being the amount of computer time required for optimi zation. Application of the method to a discrete service time, multipriority queue demonstrates that, at least in the cases tested, only a marginal increase in aggregate social welfare is obtained from establishing multiple priorities in a service system. A major shift occurs, however, in the incidence of bene- fits. Approved for publication: By Engineering Economic Systems By Dean of the Graduate Division -iv-""]"

The tactite deposits are replacements of Paleozoic calcareous meta- sediments, localized in an asymmetric north-plunging anticline in interbedded marble, calc-hornfels, and siliceous hornfelses. A Mesozoic quartz monzonite stock exposed on the surface and in underground workings of the mine has intruded the metasediments and may be genetically related to the tungsten mineralization and tactites. Types of metasomatism represented by tactites at the Black Rock mine are iron-magnesia-silicate and hydrothermal ore metasomatism. Chemical analyses of marble and tactite indicate that the principal constituents added were Sio2 Fe, A12031 and MnO and principal losses were of CO2 and CaO. Mineralogic and petrographic studies and chemical analyses indicate that the common tactite minerals, amphibole, garnet, and pyroxene, contain unusual amounts of iron and manganese and the concentrations of these metals are higher in these minerals from ore grade tactites than in the same minerals from low grade and barren tactites. Three types of garnets are distinguished: andradite, grossular, and lmandine-spessartine. Field observations and spectrographic analyses indicate that the tungsten-bearing tactites developed by replacement of relatively pure marble whereas many of the more abundant barren tactites developed from impure marble and calc- hornfels. Greater amounts of Ti, Cr, Ni, Sc, V, Y, and Zr found in barren tactites relative to tungsten-bearing tactites reflect the original detrital content of the impure calcareous rocks. iv Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Previous design approaches for the sypthesis of VTOL aircraft controllers have treated rotor and fuselage as dynamically un- coupled systems, and generally the rotor dynamics have been neglected in synthesizing the fuselage controls. Only the low-speed flight regime around hover is considered for this design. The equations for the rotor dynamics and rotor forces on the fuselage are obtained from an analysis of blade motions. The controls-fixec dynamic response of the two rigid body approximation is determined for a typical vehicle with an articulated rotor and also with a hingeless rotor. A controller has been designed for the two rigid body approximation using eigenvector decomposition of the Euler-Lagrange equations of quadra- tic synthesis. Through a unique statement of these equations, eigenvec- tor decomposition is applied to the model follower and smoothing problems. A new computer program, using an improved QR eigensystem solver routine, is developed. The program also determines the steady state RMS response of an optimally controlled system to random winds. This computer program is used to design high and low order control- lers for hovering vehicles. The effects of the order of the rotor repre- sentations on this controller are evaluated. It is found that the con- troller for the two rigid body model requires rotor state feedback gains comparable in magnitude to fuselage state gains for a quadratic cost which involves only fuselage state. Furthermore, it is found that control- 1er design based on lower order rotor models can lead to reduced damping and even instability in the complete rotor fuselage approximation. The application of a random rotor torque on the vehicle with the complete and reduced order controllers indicates an increase in RMS fuse- lage and rotor state response when the lower order controllers are used. The possibility of blade instability due to rotor plane feedback is examined by multivariable Floquet theory. It is shown that such rotor iii plane feedback may cause blade instability and it is concluded that such an analysis should be included in the control system design. The dynamic models, analysis methods, and computer programs developed during this research should provide a major improvement in the performance prediction and control of rotary-wing VTOL aircraft. iv']"

In mathematical form, the problem reduces to that of the minimization of a functional under constraints taking the form of partial differential equations to be satisfied inside the domain covered by the structure. This appears to be a special case of the general theory of optimal control of systems with distributed parameters: a presentation, together with a survey of a few important papers, is made of the subject. The first part of the present study is an extension of the classical methods of control theory to derive the necessary conditions in the case of two-dimensional systems. An application is then made in the second part for the theoretical case of the minimum-mass design of a simply-supported shear plate for a fixed fundamental frequency of vibration, under the structural mass assumption, for which an optimal thickness distribution in analytical form is found. The case of a minimal constraint placed on the thickness is then investigated. In the third and fourth part respectively, the theory developed in Part A is applied to the minimum-mass design of a sandwich plate and of an elastic plate for a given fundamental frequency of free vibration. Under the most general conditions, the optimization problem reduces to the solution of two simultaneous partial differential equations to be satisfied by the optimal thick- ness distribution together with the corresponding displacement mode. The first one is the expression of the uniformity of the energy distribution which was pointed out by Ashley and McIntosh for the optimal frequency design of one-dimensional struc- tures, and for various design criteria in one and two diminensions by Prager and Taylor. The second one is the original constraint equation. These are shown in Part E to be also sufficient conditions for an extremum, using a theorem by Prager applicable to a very general class of structural optimiza- tion problems in up to three dimensions, of which the optimal frequency design of a plate with prescribed vanishing displacement along the edge is a particular case. A numerical solution is presented for the case of a simply-supported square sandwich plate. iii']"

The Salton Trough and Gulf of California have formed as two large plates of the earth's crust move diagonally apart relative to one another. Reconnaissance geology of the area shows that the ranges, which trend northwesterly approximately parallel to the Salton Trough, contain biotite and hornblende schist, granitic gneisses, granitic rocks, and widely scattered mesa-forming volcanic rocks. The Sierra del Pinacate of Sonora is a Quaternary shield volcano composed of olivine basalt which covers over 1000 km² of the pre-Quaternary terrain. The Bouguer anomaly map constructed from the gravity survey shows that anomalies range from -7 - to -35 mgals over bedrock exposures to -40 to -55 mgals over the centers of alluvial basins. Interpretation of the gravity data shows that basins northeast of the Salton Trough trend northwesterly and are from 0.25 to 1.25 kms deep. No north- easterly trending grabens, which would locate a spreading center, were detected. The gravity anomaly over the deep sedimentary basin of the Salton Trough is not as low as expected because sediment densities increase with depth and because the crust is tectonically thinned. In order to cover a large area and also detect northeasterly trending anomalies which might be associated with spreading, the aero- magnetic survey was flown on north-south lines 5 km apart and at 1.3 km barometric elevation. The total field, residual magnetic map constructed iii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The magnetic anomalies re- flect the structural grain of the area and trend predominately to the northwest. Measurements of susceptibilities and remanent magnetizations of rock samples provide constraints for geologic models constructed from magnetic profiles. Interpretation of geophysical and geologic data indicates some 30 km of strike-slip offset across the area northeast of the Salton Trough with an accompanying 2 - 3 km of extension. From the magnetic data, there is a large step in the basement ( ~3 km) between the Salton Trough and the adjacent terrain to the northeast. Geophysical data also shows that extensive buried sheets of basalt occur in at least two of the basins in Arizona. The region of subdued magnetic anomalies in the northern Gulf of California is due to either deeply buried continental crust or crust transitional between continental and oceanic which has a shallow depth (11 km) to the Curie isotherm. Comparison of the zone of subdued anomalies with other areas formed by spreading of the earth's crust suggests that an inherent geologic mechanism causes subdued magnetic anomalies during early stages of spreading. iv Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The approach taken is consistent with the theory of decision analysis and rests philosophically on the Bayesian or subjectivist viewpoint regarding matters of uncertainty. The results form fundamental practical tools for solving basic expert resolution problems. The first development is the creation of a theoretical structure with which to view the problem in a logical consistent way. The revela- tion of an expert's prior probability assessment is viewed as an addition to a decision maker's current state of knowledge. Application of the tools of Bayesian inference provides a means whereby a decision maker can update his own prior assessment consistent with his subjective ap- praisal of the expert. By natural extension a multi-expert inferential structure is obtained. A major part of the dissertation is the development of a practical methodology for expert use. The basic result is that a set of expert prior probability assessments (priors) may be processed in two steps: Step 1 A surrogate expert prior is formed by multiplying the product of the given expert priors by a subjectively assessed calibration function and normalizing. Step 2 The decision maker's posterior probability assess- ment is calculated as the normalized product of his own prior and the surrogate prior. iv The calibration function is a representation of the decision maker's appraisal of the experts. A detailed analysis of this function is pre- sented, demonstrating that it may be computed from a set of conceptually direct assessments specified by the decision maker. Important for physical insight and practical simplification is the introduction of the technique of trajectory analysis. In the single expert case the surrogate prior represents the trans- lation of the expert's probability assessment into the decision maker's probability language. In the multi-expert situation the surrogate prior is thought of as the calibrated prior of a conceptual surrogate expert, whose state of information represents (to the decision maker) the com- bined knowledge of the group of experts. The theory developed also provides insights into aspects of the group decision making problem. Conditions are specified under which a group of decision makers should agree regarding the implications of ex- pert opinion. Also presented are normative conditions for consensus among a group of assessors. Three important aspects of expert use are focused on and modeled in a detailed way. These are the treatment of expert bias, the use of experts in experimental situations, and the relationship between the use of expert judgments and the use of formal analytic models. In- cluded is a study, important in its own right, of the proper use of formal models. An entire chapter is devoted to the derivation of new results in subjective probability theory. We introduce a means by which an assessor can assign probabilities consistent with his knowledge about his v ability as a probability assessor. The Method of Equivalent Intervals is presented as a new probability assessment technique which ensures that an assessor's assigned prior is calibrated. The results form a fundamental link with the theory of expert use. Approved for publication: By For Major Department By Dean of Graduate Studies vi""]"

Sinnott Little research has been performed in an organized and quantitative manner to define the effects of varying metallurgical parameters on abrasive wear. It was the intent of this study to contribute to the scientific know- ledge of high stress abrasion from the metallurgical point of view of relating structure to properties. A series of 27 Fe-C-Cr and Fe-C-Cr-Mo alloys with constant Cr:C ratios of 6.64 ranging from 1.40% C and 9.44% Cr to 5.07% C and 33.56% Cr with 0 , 1.5, or 3 percent Mo in some of the hypo- eutectic alloys were prepared. The alloys were designed to determine the effects of volume fraction, morphology and composition of (Cr, Fe) CC3 carbides on high stress abrasion resistance. This was accomplished by increasing the Cr and C contents to vary the above carbide parameters while the matrix structure in all the alloys was austenitic and its properties were approximately constant. To study small changes in the carbide properties required a test which yields precise data and discriminates between materials. Since no such test was available, one was devised and evaluated. In the test developed, the xviii specimen is abraded by sliding contact with bonded abrasives. To evaluate the abrasive wear response of the apparatus, six ferrous alloys were tested under varying abrasion conditions of abrasive type (alumina, silicon carbide, and garnet) , load (3.5 to 29.2 pounds for a k-inch diameter pin), and abrasive particle size (80 to 200 microns) It was found that alumina is most suited for studies of ferrous alloys containing carbides of different microstructural properties. The abrasive test conditions of 15-pound loading for a - inch diameter pin specimen on 80-micron particle size alumina abrasive yielded the most precise and reproducible data. Under these conditions the test discriminated between the alloys tested and rated them similarly to the ranking of the field tests in an ore grinding ball mill. The 95 percent confidence limits on the mean weight loss reported as a percentage of the mean ranged from +0.353 percent to +0.931 percent for the alloys tested. The Fe-C-Cr and Fe-C-Cr-Mo alloys were tested using the above abrasion parameters which simulate severe high stress abrasion. The high stress abrasion resistance of the hypoeutectic alloys did not increase with an increase in eutectic carbide volume fraction. A small decrease in abrasion resistance corresponding to one percent per ten percent increase in eutectic carbide volume was found. The different eutectic carbide morphologies had very little effect on high stress abrasion resistance. A two-fold in- crease in the carbide shape parameter (area/perimeter) xix improved the high stress abrasion resistance by approxi- mately 5 percent. The abrasion resistance of the hypo- eutectic alloys is increased by 2 percent per percent of Mo addition. The greatest effect in increasing high stress abrasion resistance was an increase in the primary carbide volume fraction of the hypereutectic alloys. The morphology of these massive primary carbides is considerably different than the eutectic carbide morphologies. The increase in primary carbide volume fraction increased the high stress abrasion resistance by one percent per percent primary carbide to an optimum at 20 volume percent. Based on the results of the present research, on scanning electron micros- copy of the abraded surfaces and on results of field ex- perience, a mechanism of high-stress abrasion for the alloys studied was proposed. xx']"

Alston Empathy is one technique used by people (e.g., by psychotherapists) to understand the emotional feelings of others. It can be characterized as ""empathically feeling the other\'s emotional feelings, these empathic feelings leading to an understanding of the other\'s feelings."" A brief glance at this concept of empathic understanding raises many interesting questions: What are empathic feelings? How do they resemble and differ from the ordinary emotional feelings of the people with whom the empa- thizer empathizes? What are the kinds of understanding that empathic feelings lead to? What conditions of empathy significantly distinguish it as a technique of emotional understanding from other techniques of emotional understanding? Answering these questions necessitates a careful inquiry into the nature of emotional feelings. From time to time, philosophers discussing the ""other minds"" problem have argued about the kind of justification a person can give for his claim that he has knowledge of the emotional feel- ings of others. Hlowever, there has not been much discussion on what it is a person has knowledge of when he has knowledge of emotional feelings. Accordingly, one of the things I try to do is give an analysis of the concept of emotional feclings that cnables us to see clearly what it is a 1 2 person has knowledge about when he has knowledge of another\'s feclings major discovery here being that the concept of emotional feclings entails interesting relationships between the feeling statc a person has and his wants, belicfs, and other psychological states. (Thus, having knowledge of another\'s emotional feelings entails having knowledge of his wants, beliefs, and so on.) Given the analysis of the concept of emotional feelings, I go on to show the essential kinds of feeling-knowledge that are required by one who uses such knowledge to empathize with other people and their emotional feelings. Moreover, we look at how the empathizer uses his feeling- knowledge to imagine the other\'s feelings. For this imagining state is precisely what empathic feelings are. And so I give an analysis of im- agined feeling states, the result being that having empathic feelings (a species of imagined emotional feelings) are ways of thinking ""hypotheti- cally"" and ""all at once"" about what one knows to be the content of another person\'s emotional feelings. After my discussion of emotional feeling-knowledge and the imagining character of empathic feelings, I go on to explore some of the different senses of ""emotional understanding,\' where ""emotional understanding"" is restricted to understanding the emotional feelings of people. I show how the different kinds of emotional understanding are identical with differ- ent capacities one has to recognize, explain or predict things relevant to a person\'s emotional feclings. With this foundation, I proceed to show how specific kinds of empathic feelings are causal factors in (i.c., lead to) the actualization of each of the specific kinds of emotional under- standing capacities, the total phenomenon here referred to as ""empathic understanding. 3 Finally, the value of empathic understanding as a kind of emotional understanding is weighed against other techniques of emotional understand- ing, with the result that there are strong pragmatic grounds for thinking of empathic understanding as in some ways superior to the nonempathic kinds of emotional understanding.']"

However, other measures of social status anxieties reveal inconclusive evidence for this explanation of right-wing behavior. The motivational patterns of Wallace campaign workers are strikingly in contrast to findings for major party acti- vists. Wallace campaign workers are motivated by ideology-- meaning political attitudes that are translated into policy concerns that the third party represents while, on the other hand, Republican and Democratic party activists often are attracted to a political party by economic and/or solidary incentives. Data on direct motivations, work satisfactions and attitudes toward the major parties emphasize the impor- tance of the dissatisfaction of these third party workers with the issue positions of the major parties as well as their agreement with the principles of the Wallace party. Two distinct groups emerge in the ideological concerns that have motivated persons to work for the Wallace party. Southern migrants, who comprise half of the respondents, are primarily dissatisfied with law and order problems which are highly correlated with their anti-Communist, anti-black and anti-civil rights attitudes. Concern over crime in the street, demonstrations, riots and inadequate law enforcement is greatest among southern migrants who also display sub- stantial opposition to integration policy and equality of the races. The second group in the motivational patterns Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Michiganders or natives of the state of Michigan appear to be much more comprehensive in their range of policy desires and in many areas closer to the goals of the radical right. This finding of two distinct groups in the ideology of the Wallace cadre probably has great significance for the organization of this third party, because the internal and external activities of a minor party structure relate to the motivations of its activists. Thus, we also comment on the kinds of problems that are likely to occur or already have emerged in the organization of the Wallace party. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Two important sources with regard to Liszt\'s ideas on pianism brought to light in this, study are the writings of Adolph Christiani and C. F. Weitzmann. In addition, the influence on Liszt by Carl Czerny, his only sig- nificant piano teacher, is investigated. Czerny\'s teaching is thoroughly examined and strong connections are drawn be- tween his methods and principles that were followed and stressed by Liszt. The study begins with a biographical section that emphasizes pedagogical influences on Liszt. This is followed by an investigation of those aspects of pianism which were important to Liszt in his playing and teaching. Included are numerous examples of Liszt\'s treatment of specific passages from the literature of the piano. This second section is summarized as follows: 1. Accentuation. This device formed perhaps the basis of Liszt\'s approach to piano playing and music in general. He used it both for basic time-keeping and evenness in passage- work and also for expressive purposes. 2. Dynamics. 3. Phrasing. 4. Rhythmic Freedom. 5. Pedalling. 6. Technical Approach. This chapter demonstrates that Liszt did not regard the ""technical side"" as an isolated aspect of piano playing, but only as inseparably combined with musical and expressive values, such as consideration of dynamics and some types of rhythmi c definition. This section shows that a possible clue to Liszt\'s legendary facility may lie in certain types of touch he strongly recommended for use in rapid passage- work. Also included are: exercises Liszt practiced himself Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Styles. This is an attempt to find Liszt\'s approach to various styles in keyboard literature, ranging from Bach through the works of Liszt himself. 8. Special Skills at the Keyboard. These include sight- reading, score-reading, and transposing. The study concludes with an examination of those psychological elements in Liszt\'s personality which possi- bly contributed to his immense success as a pianist.

Levinson, Professor of Physics Current Algebra and the equivalence of the pion field and the diver- gence of the axial-vector current on the pion mass shell are applied to the study of pion production in nucleon-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus col- lisions. In the soft-pion limit for nucleon-nucleus collisions a sim- ple form for the pion-production cross-section is obtained which when averaged over projectile and target spins is proportional to a single off- mass-shell nuclear amplitude. When all final nuclear states are summed the pion production cross-section is found to be proportional to the for- ward scattering amplitude of the projectile-target system off the energy shell by an amount essentially equal to the pion energy. Non-relativistic dispersion relations are used to continue the production amplitude back to the pion mass shell. The physical amplitude is shown to be given largely by the DWBA approximation with an effective potential for pion production. This potential is applied to the study of pion production in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Expressions are derived for the pion-produc- tion cross-section which turn out to be sensitive to the real well depth of the nuclear optical well.

Levine Using Newtonian Mechanics, a mathematical model is derived to represent small motions relative to an inertial reference coordinate system of a large, unsymmetrical, rigid spacecraft in low, circular Earth-orbit. The resulting system equation is a set of- coupled, linear differential equations with periodic coefficients and periodic forcing functions whose state-space representation is given by x = A(t)x + Z (t) where x E R² is the state vector, ( ) ) = A (t+T) is an n x n matrix, z(t) = Z (t+T) € R², and n = 6. The periodicity of the elements of A(t) and two of the elements of Z (t) are due to the effects of the Earth\'s gravitational field on the unsymmetrical space- craft. The periodicity of the remaining elements of Z (t) are caused by the aerodynamic torque, which becomes significant because of the size of the vehicle and the density of the Earth\'s atmosphere in low orbits. The attitude of the space- craft is kept close to the inertial reference by a set of Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The first main result of this research is the development of the zero-fuel mode; a three-axis oscillatory motion corresponding to the unique, forced periodic solution of the system equation. This motion is then used in lieu of the point x = 0 as a target set for the development of a control law. It is called the zero-fuel mode because, (assuming an ideal, deterministic system) once the state of the system is properly initialized by the thrusters no further control action is required. When the parameters of an early model of NASA\'s Skylab vehicle are substituted into the system equation, the amplitudes of the oscillations are relatively small and cause no significant reduction in the performance of the spacecraft\'s mission. In physical terms the trajectory of the zero-fuel mode is similar to the usual controlled trajectory produced by the thrusters and is viewed as a ""natural"" limit cycle that is produced in part by the aerodynamic torque. In abstract terms this result is shown to be the generalization to nulti-dimensional, coupled periodic systems of a series of recent results on the minimum- fuel control of constant, single-input single-output systems with a constant forcing function. The next phase of the study is concerned with the development of a control law to keep the actual motion of the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

This is especially important for the Skylab model for which motions away from the target set are shown to be unstable. The chosen control law u(y), where u is a piecewise constant function of y and Y a linear function of x, is selected for its ease of implementation and because it produces a feedback system with excellent closed-loop stability properties. A demonstration of the stability of the controlled system is provided by the second main result contained herein: an application of some recent generalizations of Ly apunov Stability Theory by Yoshizawa and LaSalle. In particular, because the selected control law includes a deadband and the open-loop system is unstable, the origin is not a limit set of the controlled motion. In addition, the combination of a bounded controller and open-loop in- stability dictate a finite domain of attraction. However, the above mentioned theory can be used to determine a com- pact set E* that includes the positive limit set of solu- tions of the closed-loop system equation as well as an estimate of the domain of attraction. It is also shown that this theory can be used to provide information on a type of bounded-input, bounded-output stability for many systems. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Keith, Jr., Doctor of Philosophy 1971 Thesis Directed By: Professor James E. A. John In this thesis, numerical solutions of the axisymmetric form of the Navier-Stokes ecuations are obtained for the steady, laminar flow of an imcompressible fluid through a circular pipe orifice plate. The method of solution employs the widely used two field method of Thom which consists of solving two coupled second order partial differential equa- tions for stream function and vorticity. Finite difference solutions of the governing equations are obtained in a rectangular graded mesh. All derivatives are approximated by five point, unevenly spaced, differences which reduce the truncation error involved with the finite difference approximation. In order to reduce round off error, double precision arithmetic is employed throughout the calculations. Both of these fea- tures have been found essential in obtaining accurate results in reasonable lengths of computing time. In the study, a typical solution consumed approximately 15 minutes of UNIVAC 1108 time. However, computer times increased with increasing Reynolds number and decreasing orifice to pipe diameter ratio. Two typest of orifice plate profiles are considered: square edge and sharp edge. The latter type is beveled at 45° in the downstream direction. Orifice to pipe diameter ratios of . 3, .4, .5, .6 and . .7 have been examined for the square-edged plate. In the case of the sharp- edged orifice, a single orifice diameter ratio of .5 was studied. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. Solutions were obtained for Reynolds numbers (based on the pipe radius and average fluid velocity in the pipe) from 0 to 12.5. Stream- line patterns and vorticity contours are presented as functions of the Reynolds number. Distributions of velocity, axial pressure drop and wall shear stress are given. Details of recirculations regions, found in front and behind the orifice plate, are shown. Numerically obtained orifice discharge coefficients are found to compare favorably with existing experimental values (within 5% of each other). Generally, the square-edged orifice discharge coefficients are predicted slightly lower than the experimental values while the predicted sharp-edged plate coefficients are slightly larger. Differences in the orifice plate geometry are thought to account for these discrepancies. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.']"

Root was one of the founders of music education in the United States. His contributions to the profession, however, have remained relatively unknown to twentieth century historians. This study examines ways in which he effectively made mass education in music a reality. He was fully involved in the musical life of his society and his time. Important social and cultural changes were in progress, most significant of which was the new relationship of masses of middle class people to education and the arts. These changing social and cultural conditions affected Root's work as a teacher and contributed to his emergence as a leader in his profession. His teaching was characterized by an attitude of concerned involvement with the musical experiences of the American peo- ple, and by a responsiveness to their musical tastes and abili- ties. He evaluated these tastes and abilities realistically, on the basis of some fifty years' experience in teaching vocal music classes. Root taught vocal music classes at all levels, from the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

He was among the first teachers of public school music classes, and one of the early leaders in the musical convention movement. He established the first normal institute in the country devoted exclusively to the preparation of music teachers. In response to the need for instructional materials, he wrote, composed, or co-authored more than seventy works of book length. Many of these were textbooks for vocal music classes, ranging from children's classes through teacher' institutes. The study of these textbooks indicates that the song reper- toire Root used in teaching was designed to interest and moti- vate students, and that its selection was determined by a real- istic, practical evaluation of students' tastes and abilities. This study shows also that Root's methodology of teaching was designed to meet the problems of mass instruction. Active participation in musical exercise on the part of all students was essential. Root arranged instructional information in carefully ordered sequence, and in small increments, to facili- tate learning. His teaching of music theory was functional in the sense that he emphasized practical usage of the traditional system of signs and symbols, as well as the inherent inter- relationships among rhythm, melody, and dynamics. Root provided for the development of several aspects of musicianship, and in two of these areas his teaching was dis- tinctive. He taught harmony largely as aural experience.

He adapted some of the techniques of private vocal pedagogy to the teaching of classes. Among the techniques he emphasized were posture, breathing, diction, and the kinds of vocalizes usually considered appropriate to private voice study. He approached the dynamic aspect of singing through the emotive import of the words to be sung, and provided both exercises and practical instructions for producing vocal tone qualities appropriate to the mood of the words. When Root began his teaching career in 1838, free public education for the children of all Americans was becoming a national goal, and musical instruction in public schools was beginning. By personally teaching thousands of students, by providing instructional materials designed to facilitate mass instruction, and by offering professional training for music teachers, he made vital contributions to the establishment of mass education in music.

Rabbit anti-human IgG serum has been iodinated and the effect of increasing chloramine T reaction time on the percentage radioiodine in- corporated studied. The maximum incorporation of radioiodine by the antiserum was 92% and an increase in iodination was proportional to length of reaction with chloramine T in every case but one. Upon elec- trophoresis the antiserum components displayed the following percentages of radioiodine incorporation: albumin (67-76%), gamma globulins (5-10%) , alpha1.2-globulins (7-12%), and the beta globulins (5-10%). The differ- ences in radioiodine substitution by each fraction during each increase in reaction time with chloramine T was also recorded. Isolation and purification of the IgG fraction of rabbit anti-human IgG serum followed by iodination allowed greater incorporation of radio- iodine into the antibody molecule. Antibodies at levels of 2.0, 1.7, 125 1.2, 0.39, and 0.31 atoms 1/molecule were tested for their activity as antibodies and antigens in precipitation and double antibody re- actions under various conditions to promote maximum binding. Only 25% of the labeled antibody would react as an antibody in precipitation tests at these levels of radioiodination, however at these and higher 125 levels (16 atoms I/antibody molecule), the antigenic potential of the labeled antibody was not markedly decreased. Radioimmunoassays were established in which radioiodine labeled human IgG participated as an antigen in a precipitation version with rabbit anti-human IgG serum, and a double antibody version using rab- bit anti-human IgG serum and goat anti-rabbit serum. Human serum IgG concentrations were determined using both the precipitation and double antibody radioimmunoassays and the results compared to concentrations determined by gel diffusion techniques. In every case the radioimmuno- assay revealed serum concentrations greater than those recorded using the gel diffusion technique.']"

Abeles, Doctor of Philosophy, 1971 Thesis directed by: Dr. Charles E. Johnson, Associate Professor of Education The purpose of this study was to examine a technique for the development of performance rating scales to measure achievement in courses where objectives require complex behaviors not easily measurable using paper and pencil achievement tests. A facet-factorial approach to rating scale construction was employed in the develop- ment of rating scales for the evaluation of clarinet music performance. Achievement measures of complex behaviors such as music performance are typically subjective judgments, based on irregular and uncontrolled observations. Because of this, it seemed desirable to structure the evaluations of complex behaviors in order to improve the precision of measurement. This was achieved by constructing a rating scale to evaluate clarinet music performance. The first step in the construction of the clarinet performance rating scale was to sample experts' criticisms of clarinet performance by having instrumental music teachers write essays descriptive of the aural aspects of a memorable clarinet performance. These essays were then content analyzed and the resulting item pool together with items generated by a literature search were placed on a five-option response scale to be employed by instrumental music teachers to rate one hundred sample junior high clarinet performances. The results of these descriptions were factor analyzed in an attempt to determine the structure of clarinet performance. The five items which were most highly loaded on each of the six resulting factors were selected to define subscales of a thirty item clarinet performance rating scale. The resulting rating scale was employed in the evaluation of ten different performances. The inter-judge reliability of the rating scale was estimated from these administrations. In order to examine criterion-related validity of the rating scales, a global criterion measure was constructed by having judges rate the thirty performances using a paired-comparison procedure. Both zero-order and multiple correlation coefficients between the rating scale and the criterion measure were obtained. The three major results of the study were : 1) a rating scale based upon a six factor structure of clarinet music performance (interpretation, tone, rhythm-continuity, intonation, tempo and articulation) ; 2) high inter-judge reliability estimates for both the total score (> .90) and scale scores (>.60) for each of the three groups of judges, evaluating three different sets of ten performances, and 3) criterion-related validity coefficients greater than .80 for each of the three different sets of performances. Results of the investigation suggest that the facet- factorial approach to scale construction can be an effective technique for the construction of rating scales to measure complex behaviors such as music performance. The rating scale for the evaluation of clarinet music performance demonstrated both high inter-judge reliability and high criterion-related validity. Further research is recommended to: 1) investigate the musical selection and musical selection by performer interaction variance contributions to reliability and validity; 2) generalize the clarinet performance scale to other instruments and other ability levels; and 3) examine the acet-factorial technique of scale construction in evaluation achievement in other complex behaviors.""]"

This relaxation was due to the presence of chemical equilibrium be- tween monomers and dimers of e-caprolactam.

David Gold, Doctor of Philosophy, 1971 Thesis directed by: Dr. Gladys A. Wiggin, Professor of Education The Soldiers' Orphan Schools of Pennsylvania were something new in the history of the United States. This was the first time a state government had undertaken the education and care of children made orphaned by war. For twenty-five years (1864-1889), soldiers' orphans between the ages of four and sixteen were reared in twelve special orphanages located throughout the Commonwealth. During this time over fifteen thousand children passed through the schools at a cost to the state of over ten million dollars. The schools were founded largely because of the efforts of Andrew Gregg Curtin, governor of Pennsylvania. Curtin seemed to be guided by political motives to do this act of charity. He saw here a way to have the electorate more readily accept his close ties with the most powerful economic force in the state, the Pennsylvania Railroad. A $50,000 gift from the railroad got the schools underway. The governor also saw this aid program as a way to successfully prosecute the Civil War. Curtin did many things to stimulate the morale and patriotism of the fighting men. Having the state care for their children was but another aspect of Curtin's program of military relief. After the Civil War and Governor Curtin's retirement from office, a different motive guided the operation of the Soldiers' Orphan Schools. They were rationalized in terms of how they were helping to preserve the order of society. The children were being prepared to become law- abiding and hard working future citizens of the Commonwealth. Practically everything that took place within the schools was directed towards the goals of obedience, discipline and order. In this respect, the educators who administered the schools were reflecting a primary concern common to schoolmen of the era. In 1889, the state decided to close the Soldiers' Orphan Schools. Three factors contributed to the failure of the institutions. First, the schools failed to provide a satisfactory program of industrial training for their students. Those who administered the system seemed to be more interested in developing moral character than teaching modern work skills. The transfer of the soldiers' orphans to an industrial training schools wholly owned by the state signified the failure of the original schools to fulfill the need for industrial education. The schools also failed because of their organizational structure. They were private schools under central, state supervision. However, the state inspectorate failed to keep a strict surveillance of the schools. Moreover, the proprietors of the private institutions were more interested in making profits than serving the needs of their wards. The eventual establishment of a single school under direct state operation suggested that the original half-private, half- public system of orphan relief was at odds with the growing tendency in the latter nineteenth century for the state to take over more control of such relief projects. Thirdly, the schools came to an end becar they unfortunately became involved in the partisan essures of Pennsylvania state politics. Members of the Republican party were closely associated with the school. In the gubernatorial election year of 1886 the Democrats sought to take advantage of this identification of the GOP with the system. The Democrats charged the Republicans with neglecting the welfare of the soldiers' orphans. In turn, the Republicans accused the Democrats with playing politics with innocent children. Eventually both sides backed off from what became a distasteful political issue. But the damage had been done. There seemed to be just enough truth in the scandalous revelations of the Democrats to call for an end of the system. But the schools had charted a new course in child care. Other northern states emulated the Pennsylvania effort and three still do. The present state facility for veterans' children at Scotland, Pennsylvania is a direct descendant of the original Soldiers' Orphan Schools. Here, five hundred soldiers' orphans continue to receive the aid of the state of Pennsylvania.""]"

The problem examined in the present study was: ""What are the effects of video tape feedback on the achievement of students in a beginning conducting class?"" The question was studied in two phases. The problem was delimited and the experimental procedures were developed in Phase I. During Phase II, the experimental phase, the procedures developed in Phase I were used to test the hypothesis. The experiment was based upon the hypothesis that students who have their conducting recorded on video tape and who study the video tapes of their conducting privately, aided by a self-evaluation guide, acquire more conducting skill than students who do not have access to video tapes of their conducting. The subjects of the experiment included all students who had enrolled in the beginning conducting course at the University of Maryland at College Park during the Fall Semester, 1970.

The basic instructional procedure used for the sub- jects in the experimental group was identical to that of the subjects in the control group. In addition, the subjects in the experimental group had their conducting recorded on video tape a total of five times during the semester. On the day following these recording sessions, each subject in the experimental group was allotted a 15 minute period in which to study and evaluate the tape of his conducting. A ""Video Tape Self-Evaluation Sheet"" was provided for each subject in the experimental group as an aid in solf- evaluation. The experiment was a randomized, experimental group- control group, pre-test-post-test design. A pre-test and post-test of the conducting of each subject in the two groups was done by means of video tape recordings. The se tests of the conducting of each subject in the two groups were rated by a panel of three conducting teachers. The judges as- signed a score to each subject on each of the ten physical attributes of conducting. These scores were the basis of the statistical analysis. Two null hypotheses were tested in the present study. 1. There will be no difference in the mean score of the two groups on the post-test of conducting ability. 2. There will be no difference in the mean score of the two groups on the post-test of conducting ability as adjusted by the pre-test results. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The null hypothesis of no differ- ence between the unadjusted criterion score means was re- jected beyond the .01 level, while the null hypothesis of no difference between the adjusted criterion score means was rejected beyond the .025 level.

Marx, Ph.D. Modeling is rapidly becoming a prominent technique in the helping relationship because of the speed and efficiency with which it facili- tates the acquisition and performance of specified behaviors. However, as Bandura (1969) has explained, the mere presentation of a model does not quarantee that the observer will attend to the model, or even know what he is looking for. Thus, the development and refinement of modeling techniques is necessary to effect stronger, more efficient modeling procedures. The study used contiguity-mediational principles of learning to investigate the effect of one type of preinterview verbal discrimination training on three dimensions of verbal behavior in a quasi-counseling interview. The three dimensions of verbal behavior were: (a) positive self-reference (PSR), (b) gative-ambiguous self-reference (N/ASR), and (c) external object reference (EOR). . t was assumed that talking about oneself, and not talking about other people or things, is an important goal in counseling process. It was hypothesized that Ss exposed to a discrimination training model (DTM), or to a. passive model (PM), would emit significantly more PSR and significantly less N/ASR and EOR than Ss exposed to no model. It was also hypothesized that Ss exposed to the DTM would emit significantly more PSR and significantly less N/ASR and EOR than Ss exposed to the PM. A random sample of 27 males and 27 females was selected from a group of 97 University of Maryland students. The students were members of two large Sociology I lecture sections who volunteered to participate in a ""student views survey. "" Ss were paid for their participation. Ss were randomly assigned, by sex, to the DTM treatment, the PM treatment, or the control group. Ss were then randomly assigned, again by s\'ex, to one of the three counselors participating in the study. Experimental Ss received instructions to discuss their feelings, attitudes, beliefs, and problems as part of an academic environment. The experimental Ss were then exposed to either the DTM or the PM. DTM treatment Ss answered short questions about the model at intervals during the model exposure. The written response sequences were seen as increasing attentional set and facilitating discriminability of efficient and inefficient verbal behavior modeled. PM treatment Ss listened to the same model, but no overt responses were required. Both models were pre- sented via standard audiotape. After exposure to the audiotape, the experimental Ss had a twenty minute interview with a counselor. Control Ss received the instructions and were immediately led to the interview sequence. The interviews with the counselors were audiotaped. Three raters trained to count the frequencies of PSR, N/ASR, and EOR emitted by each of the Ss reviewed the tapes. The experimenter participated as one of the three raters. The frequencies of PSR, N/ASR, and EOR provided the data for hypothesis testing. Analysis of variance procedures, for dif- ferences in the mean number of emissions for each of the three dependent variables, were used to test the hypotheses. The level of statistical significance was set at .05 using a one-tail test. Results indicated that the DTM treatment Ss did not emit significantly more PSR than PM treatment Ss. A post hoc analysis revealed that S s ex- posed to either the DTM or the PM did emit more PSR than control Ss (p <.05) . For the N/ASR and the EOR variables, it was found that the modeling treatments did not differentiate. Ss exposed to the DTM and the PM did not emit significantly less N/ASR or EOR than the control Ss. The sex and counselor factors had been controlled for in the design. The data indicated that females emitted more PSR than did males (p <.05). There were no sex differences found for the N/ASR and EOR variables. No differences were found between the three counselors used in the experi- ment as measured by Ss\' emission of PSR, N/ASR, and EOR. Several explanations for the results were offered and discussed. Additionally, methodological limitations of the study were examined as were suggestions for further research.']"

Stern, Professor of Botany Five species of Cassytha (Lauraceae). -C. ciliolata, C. filiformis, c. glabella, C. melantha, and C. pubescens, were investigated anatomi- cally. Comparative studies were done on mature stems, stem tips, leaves, and both developing and mature haustoria. The mode of parasitism was studied on a variety of host plants ranging from herbaceous to woody. Based on these investigations, there is no anatomical justification for the removal of Cassytha from the Lauraceae into a separate, monogeneric family. To the contrary, there are many points of similarity between Cassytha and other Lauraceae. Direct comparisons of xylem anatomy be- tween Cassytha and other laurels are not made because of the almost total predominance of only primary xylem in the former; however, some interesting points of similarity between the xylem of the two groups are noted. It is suggested that a comparison of the primary xylem of Cassytha and several autotrophic lauraceous genera might be profitable scientifically. The unusual type of secondary growth which occurs in conjunction with haustorial formation in Cassytha is related to the amount of xylem present in the host plants. Possible reasons for the apparent preference of the parasite for woody rather than herbaceous host plants are given. Anatomically, Cassytha is very homogenous.

Among the species studied, the only distinguishing anatomical features of possible taxonomic significance occur in C. glabella. Haustoria were studied in terms of their origin, development, morphology, tissue components, mode of penetration into host, and con- nections to host tissues. Haustoria were found to consist of two dis- tinct parts, an attachment cup and a penetration wedge, each arising endogenously from separate meristematic areas of the parasite stem. Morphology of the penetration wedge is variable, depending on the amount and arrangement of vascular tissue in the host plant. Only direct vessel element to vessel element connections between the haus- toria and host are reported; however, the presence of sieve tubes in the phloem of haustoria in all species is confirmed.

Especially in a society where a vast majority of the people consider themselves being ethnically organized as a homogeneous national state, the presence of a national minority tends to create even more of an acute problem. It appears that Japan with its Korean minority falls under this category. Perhaps, the notable difference between the status of the Korean minority in Japan and major minority groups in other countries is that the Korean minority in Japan is legally regarded as alien, as is not the case in other countries. The underlying assumption in this study is that the group is the basic unit of society. However, this study is not concerned with testing the validity of the group theory. Because the Korean minority group does not seem to fit neatly into the nature of ""group"" conceived by many group theorists. In the first place, the Koreans in Japan are neither legitimate members of that society nor are they endowed with the right of political participation, which would enable them to process their demands and support in the Japanese political system. However, this study has found that the Japanese people in general seem to show little temperment to accom- modate the presence of the Korean minority in the Japanese society. Two persistent patterns of the Japanese govern- ment policy loom large: one is to reduce the number of Koreans through repatriation and the other is to compell Koreans to conform and assimilate into the Japanese norm 3, As to the latter policy, the Mindan members are more amenable to it, while the Chosoren has shown firm deter- mination to safeguard its own ethnic identity and culture. Since the Mindan has offered neither a cohesive ideological force nor a strong leadership to tie its members together, they are likely to turn to their immediate surroundings for adaptation to secure a feeling of attachment and of belonging to a majority. Whereas the Chosoren has demonstrated its capability of offering a monolithic answer to the problems of cohesion and unity to protect its interest but chiefly through com- plete and firm control of its members. The Chosoren has often used effective technique of combining legal with illegal work, legal with illegal organizations to secure their rights and to protect their interests in close collaboration with the Japanese Communist Party and Socialists.']"

Ruth S. Ralph, Doctor of Philosophy, 1971 Thesis directed by: Dr. Leonard Woolf, Associate Professor of Education. For the past thirty-eight years, general semantics, a way of deal- ing with language, has been advocated by some educators and psycholo- gists. It is recommended as a content area to improve language arts instruction and as an instructional method that results in a more rea- sonable logic, a closer approximation between reality and symbols, and consequently, better personality adjustment. This study describes ex- perimental projects that have evaluated the effects of general semantics and adds one more investigation to the body of evidence. It suggests that general semantics may contribute to personal and social adjustment, and that the scientific methods of objective evaluation should be used to investigate this. The principles of general semantics are taught in many colleges and high schools, but they are not so frequently offered in elementary y schools. However, one project using general semantics as a curricular base has been going on for the past four and one-half years at Fort Myer Elementary School, Arlington, Virginia. This may be the only Amer- ican school so deeply committed to general semantics, and its results are therefore pertinent to this study. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. There have been a number of studies evaluating the effects of general semantics on both the psychological development and intel- lectual abilities of adolescents and adults; and in terms of such school performance factors as reading readiness, other language arts skills, and creativity, experiments using elementary school children trained in general semantics have been conducted. In such experiments, the emphasis was upon the intellectual rather than the emotional problems of the child. The present study considers for the first time the effect of general semantics on the personality adjust- ment of children. There are two hypotheses in this study : (1) There is a relationship between general semantics compe- tency and personality adjustment in that subjects who score high on a test of general semantics competency will score low on a test for neuroticism and anxiety. (2) A group of elementary school children trained in general semantics will score higher on a test of general semantics competency and lower on a test for neuroticism and anxiety than will an untrained. group otherwise matched on race, home stability, age, sex, socioeconomic status, intelligence, reading ability, total language ability, and work-study skills. A review of the research disclosed no wide-spectrum test of gen- eral semantics competency appropriate for elementary school children, although there were several single-factor tests suitable for adoles- cents and adults. Therefore, it was necessary to develop such a test. The General Semantics Competency Opinion Test (GSC) was written Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. and partially validated as a tool for. this study. It is hoped that with further refinement and additional validation, the GSC Test can become a useful instrument for general semantics teachers An item analysis based on this study's administration of the GSC Test to 153 subjects shows that the mean is 19.87 (out of 38 items), the standard deviation is 5.38, the Kuder Richardson Formula 20 esti- mate of internal consistency is .75, average difficulty of the test is 52.32, and average discrimination is .40. This study used two groups of fifth and sixth grade children from U. S. ariny base schools. The group trained in general semantics at Fort Myer Elementary School totalled 46 subjects. The untrained group from Pershing Hill Elementary School, Fort Meade, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, totalled 107 subjects. These groups were found to be closely matched on all relevant variables. In testing the difference between the two groups on general semantics competency and the Children's Personality Questionnaire factors of anxiety and neuroticism, the t test probability differences were: GSC, .02; anxiety, .00, and neuroticism, .05. Since the .05 level of probability was considered critical, these figures support hypothesis #2. In an analysis of the total group, the correlation coefficients between the GSC score, and the two factors of neuroticism and anxiety were -.24 and -.26 respectively, which are significant at the .01 level of probability. These figures support hypothesis #1, indicating that general semantics competency is related to some aspects of personality adjustment. Further investigation will be needed to deter mine the importance of this relationship. The study, therefore, supplies experimental evidence leading Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

(2) General semantics instruction in elementary school is likely to improve pupils' emotional adjustment, since students trained in general semantics scored higher in general semantics competency and lower in anxiety and neuroticism than did another group matched with them on all other relevant variables.

A method for determining the crystal content of chlorinated films by IR measurements is described. The results for chlorination and grafting show the least scatter when expressed in terms of weight gain per unit weight of amorphous film. This indicates that both processes take place principally in the amorphous region. The graft yield, expressed as percent graft, was found to increase with increasing weight percent of chlorine added to the amorphous fraction of the film (PCA), approaching a limiting value for grafting of BD liquid to polyethylene films with PCA greater than 45. For grafting to PECL and PVC from methanol-butadiene Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Except for an early transient condition, the grafting rate from liquid butadiene to PVC was found to be almost in- dependent of dose rate in the range from 3 - 300 krad/hr. However, the early graft rate is very high, and increases with increasing dose rate. The results of the investigation show that chlorination of the amorphous PE increases the glass transition temperature of the polymer, and that greatly increased graft yields are obtained when Tg is made to approach the reaction temperature. Further increase in graft yield is obtained upon dilution of the monomer by providing conditions of monomer concentration and polymer viscosity that more closely approach an optimum. The results are explained in terms of the effect of the added chlorine and the sorbed monomer on the viscosity of the swollen amorphous polymer. The effect of chlorine content on the radical yield is shown to play a small role in the enhancement of the graft yield. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Jashemski, Professor By focusing on one small part of the Roman world, this study seeks to make a small contribution to the body of knowledge about freedmen in the Roman Empire. By concentrating on Pompeii we are able to take advantage of the unique evidence preserved for us there by the erup- tion of Mt. Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Evidence from Herculaneum, much less plentiful, is brought in where appropriate. In order that the freedmen of Pompeii may be seen in their proper context, an introductory chapter deals with the freedmen of the Roman Empire in general. The reasons for and the methods of manumission are discussed, as are the numbers of freedmen and the relationship of freed- men to society. Attention is given to the identification of freedmen, which is an important part of the study of freedmen in Pompeii. Those who were certainly freedmen at Pompeii are distinguished from those who were probably freedmen. Freedmen played a significant role in the religious life of Pompeii. Sometimes they appeared in official positions, as, for example, priests of Augustus or Fortuna Augusta, Augustales, magistri vicorum or magis- trates of the suburb Pagus Augustus Felix. All of these positions were apparently concerned with the imperial cult, in which the highest official function of freedmen at Pompeii is to be found. In that connection we Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. find a number of instances of recognition by the city officials. Honors for freedmen often took the place of the office a freeborn man could hold. One freedman also seems to have been head of a Jewish synagogue in Pcmpeii. Other evidence shows the participation of freedmen in wor- ship of genius or Lares or of one deity or another. Freedmen also had an important place in the economic life of Pompeii. They were engaged in respected occupations as well as in work of a lowly nature. A number were wine producers who apparently owned their own farms and thus had entered into an area that had always been considered respectable for freeborn Romans. Other freedmen managed estates. Freedmen and probable freedmen were found among the teachers, physicians, architects, actors, gladiators, bankers, business agents, producers of garum, wine merchants, caupones, proprietors of food shops, holders of concessions at the amphitheater, fullers, dyers, felt makers, spinners and weavers, ship owners, managers of baths, proprietors of pottery shops and other shops, perfumers, public swineherds, jewellers, flower dealers and oil producers and dealers. Many freedmen had humble positions in the economic life of Pompeii, but others are found throughout the entire range of economic activity, from small business to business ventures involving considerable wealth. Gifts to the city or to some temple, or the provision of gladiators for shows give evidence of wealth. Tombs, elaborate or simple, give indica- tion of the economic position, status and tastes of freedmen. Some freedmen, like Petronius' Trimalchio, were ostentatious, seeking every honor, deserved or not. Others were simple, unassuming citizens.

Inscriptions identify many other freed- men about whom little is known. The social position of freedmen was fixed first of all by their servile birth. Yet, largely by wealth or service to the city or its inhabitants, many sought to advance in social status. The lower classes, including the freedmen, were increasingly taking over at Pompeii.

Prange Less than six months after the Japanese surprise aerial attack on the naval bastion at Pearl Harbor, the United States scored a resounding victory that has been termed as the turning point of the war in the Paci- fic. On 4 June 1942 carrier-based naval aircraft destroyed four of the six fleet carriers that Japan had used to launch her attack on Hawaii. Before the battle was over on 6 June, yet another ship, a powerful heavy cruiser would succumb to the aerial onslaught of the carrier-based bombers. Few battles in modern times have offered such an opportunity to analyze the burden and responsibilities of command. Each side demon- strated the positive traits of leadership and each was guilty of serious breaches in duties of command. For the Japanese, Midway repre- sented the beginning of their second phase operations, one that con- templated cutting the Solomons, isolating Australia, and perhaps as- saulting Hawaii. Midway introduced a supremely confident Goliath sailing from Japan to capture an island small er than Tokyo itself. Taking the Island of Midway was to be but the bait for an even more important event - the destruction of the U. S. Pacific Fleet.

The advanced information enabled the American commander to position his only three carriers on the flank of the approaching Japanese. Then at just the proper moment the U. S. ships launched a heavy concentration of air- craft. Many were destroyed as they attacked the Japanese, but others arrived unseen and dropped their bombs on the enemy carriers. The decisions reached during these crucial moments had momentous affects on the ultimate outcome of the battle. Through superior command decisions, Admirals Nimitz, Spruance, and Fletcher turned the tide of Japanese offensive power. By the same token, junior officers like McClusky, Leslie, and the torpedo squadron leaders - Waldron, Lindsey, and Massey - carried the weight of com- mand and exerted it in the fulle st sense of the word. Their inspiring leadership and determination made the Battle of Midway an emphatic American victory when the preponderance of Japanese naval and air po wer indicated that events should have gone otherwise. In contrast the Japanese from Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in- - Chief of the Combined Fleet, and Admiral Nagumo, commander of Japan's carrier striking force, to those lower leadership echelons failed to ex- hibit the same mature and sound judgment prior to and during the Battle of Midway as did their American counterparts. Their faulty command decisions were largely responsible for their defeat in this crucial naval engagement. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Robert Bell, Doctor of Philosophy, 1971 Thesis Directed by: George Fenwick Jones, Ph.D., Professor of German and Comparative Literature The story of Christ\'s descent to Hell-including his harrowing of Satan and his raising of those imprisoned -- was a favorite religious tale of the Western mediaeval period. Heretofore it was believed that the original source for the episode was the Gospel of Nicodemus, an apocryphal work created out of Old and New Testament materials and patristic references from the period of the Early Church. Likewise, it was assumed that mediaeval adaptations of this story were uninspired, slavish vernacularizations without individuality or unique artistry. It was the purpose of this dissertation to examine not only the origins of the story, but to study the major examples of the story as it was re- ceived and given an artistic interpretation in early mediaeval literature. A search of the most important pagan and Judaeo-Christian descent tales revealed that the ""Harrowing of Hell"" portions of the Gospel of Nicodemus are ultimately derived from several sources: the Sumerian- based resurrection myths connected to Inanna and Dumuzi and their ""successors""; the eschatological, messianic traditions of the Hebrews; and the apocalyptic writings of the New Testament and the Church Fa- thers. These various traditions were drawn together during the period from the Council of Nicaea to the early years of the fifth century, and they were expressed first in shortened form by the creeds, secondly by hymnographers. By the time the first Greek versions of the Gospel appeared, the ""truth"" of the ""Harrowing"" was anachronistically veri- fied by its own sources. The ""Harrowing of Hell"" was promoted in the West through the enormously popular writings of S. Augustine and Gregory the Great. S. Augustine, first to accept the descent tale as canonical, interpreted it to say that Christ delivered sinners from Hell, and that those who died in service to the Church were spared the pains of Hell. Gregory expanded these ideas to include a Hell with various levels, and im- - mediate deliverance for martyrdom. Gregory\'s missionary efforts enabled the Gospel to be disseminated throughout the West; his four- level system of biblical interpretation authorized the use of the Gospel by connecting its Christian teachings with pagan folk-literature. Old English vernacular adaptations of the Gospel vary from a sim- ple mention of the descent to a rather highly elaborate mediaevalized translation of the ""Harrowing"". Even though the English adaptations depended on the Latin I version (as did the other Western ones), there are signs that the story was amplified by patristic texts. The Cotton Vitellius A. xv MS prepared the way for the Gospel to be included in ecclesiastical cycle dramas. Irish variants combined the descent motif with hagiography to provide works which included Ss. Patrick and Brendan as viewers of the pains of Hell. The inventive Irish produced works which employed the ""Harrowing"" outside of the usual Passion narratives. In Old High German, the commentaries of Augustine and Gregory on the Gospel take precedence over the text itself. The enigmatic Muspilli made an interesting political interpolation of the salvation of martyrs fit the contemporary situation of Ludwig the German\'s machi- nations with the royal fisc, his brother, and the proprietary Church. This poem adapted the commentaries in such a way that they were used to threaten Ludwig: his behavior warranted correction because his ac- tions appeared apocalyptic to the clergy. The Song of Roland also employed the Gospel commentaries to show how Roland, Turpin, and others gained Paradise through martyr - dom, and that the pagans were doomed to the hellish host. Therefore, it appeared that the ""Harrowing of Hell"" is only a Christian variant of a pagan motif; that the mediaevalized versions can- not be attributed to a single, ""unique"" source; and that the early medi- aeval literary versions are thoughtfully artistic.']"

This model has been solved for ""normal"" conditions in mammalian trachea, and for cases in which the mucus departs from its normal state. A ""patho- logical"" flow and a purely Newtonian case are also considered. A two-fluid system with a visco-elastic upper layer and a Newtonian sublayer models the mucous-serous fluid layers in the mammalian system. A wall material point (possibly, but not necessarily corresponding to a cilim tip) moves in a closed ellipse. The wall is extensible, but is at rest on the average. The mucous layer is bounded above by a gas at constant pressure, so there is a free surface and consequently no ""squeezing"" effects as in peristaltic pumping. Inertial and gravitational forces are found to be negligible relative to viscous forces in normal muco-ciliary flow. Surface tension (which may be important) is neglected for simplicity. A pathological case with a deep, ""watery"" mucus in which gravity affects the flow is considered. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Functions are assumed to be periodic in distance and time, so that each order solution can be expanded in Fourier series. Solutions are found correct to OCE"" where € is the ratio of wall amplitude to total depth of fluid. The particle trajectories and cyclic drift of mucus and serous fluid are found. The average speed (i.e. ""mucous flow rate"") is then determined. Values for normal flow agree roughly with physiological data. Near the normal state, the mucous layer moves nearly like an elastic slab, in a direction opposite to the travelling geometric wave of the wall. Changes in mucous viscosity do not affect the drift. For a given ciliary motion, however, the drift increases if the serous viscosity decreases, the modulus of rigidity (i. e. elastic modulus) of the mucus increases, or the ciliary beating frequency increases (at fixed wave speed). The drift decreases if the depth of the serous layer (above the waving wall) decreases, or if the cilia change the form of their beat so that, for example, the ellipticity of a wall point path decreases.

This extraction of plasticizers is a consequence of the protein and/or the lipid content of such fluids and does not occur with saline solutions. The administration of one plasticizer, butyl glycolylbutyl phthalate, in both the intact rat (ip) and isolated, perfused rat liver (iv) results in the appearance of glycolyl phthalate. The exact structure of this metabo- lite is demonstrated through the use of analytical techniques. A second plasticizer, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, was found to be extracted from PVC plastic tubing, but its metabolism to phthalic acid could not be demonstrated in the rat. Accumulation of this plasticizer by tissues was seen to occur in the rat when the plasticizer was given by an intravenous route, and specifically, concentration occurred in the lung, liver and spleen of the intact rat, as well as in the isolated perfused rat liver. Tissues from some humans who had been exposed to di-2-ethyl- hexyl phthalate-contaminated - blood were found to contain this plasticizer. Not all cases were positive for this material, and metabolism of this compound in the human could be shown when the methods of Shaffer et al (1945) were employed. Further, it was observed that in urine from normal human subjects, a phthalic acid containing material could be found after hydrolysis, and thus, a possible source of some phthalate compound as an environmental (dietary) contaminant was suspected. ii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Rats and mice were found to have enhanced hexobarbital sleeping times after the intraperitoneal injection of the plasticizer di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (500 mg/kg). Further, decrements in behavior, losses in body weight, and decreased food and water consumption were also observed. It was shown that the material was an irritant to the peritoneal cavity, and thus, some of its effects on pharmacologic and behavioral responses could be ascribed to some stress mediated effect. It was further observed that intravenous injection of large doses of the plasticizer di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate resulted in a highly significant loss in body weight. Polyvinyl chloride materials were found to cause platelet aggre- gation but this could be altered by prior treatment of the blood storage bag with a wall bonded heparin coating. Another plastic material which contains no plasticizer was not found to alter the degree of platelet aggregation with storage. Isolated units of platelet rich plasma were found to contain high concentrations of the plasticizer di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate after only two days of storage. The concentration of the plasticizer recovered from the packed platelet fraction was found to be two times greater than that found in the surrounding plasma. A role of this phthalate ester in reducing the platelet viability of stored human platelet concentrates may be possible. Experiments on isolated beating heart cells in tissue culture indicated that both di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and di-2-ethylhexyl adipate were toxic to these cells.

Two models are proposed using the ideas of 1. representing a drainage surface mathematically as Z = 2 (x,y,t) 2. approximating sediment transport per unit width (9s ) as some function of surface gradient ( 10zl ) and the discharge of water per unit width (q ) : 9s = F (N21,9) 3. using the principles of conservation of water and sediment. The first (basic) model is constructed using the additional assumptions that 1. water and sediment move down the surface gradient 2. the rainfall (a) is steady and uniform; there is no evapora- tion or infiltration; and the substrate is homogeneous. Hence one obtains the (determinate) system: V.

When n < 1, the profile is convex; when n\'= 1, straight; and when n > 1, concave. The behaviour of 9s = F (5, q) on the associated steady-state surface is analogous to 9s = kgn n sm, n < 1, on convexities and to 95=kgnsm = n ( 1, on concavities. The one-dimensional steady-state solutions are extended without variation in the y-direction. The basic problem is to determine the stability of these surfaces with respect to small perturbations. The results of this analysis_ are: 1. the surface is stable with respect to perturbations with no y-variation. 2. adding a y-component to the perturbations changes the direction but not the magnitude of the gradient. 3. for general perturbations, convex portions of a steady-state surface are stable, since, by 9 S = F (s q ) behaving like 9s = kgnsm, n < I , converging fluxes of water deposit sediment.

Hence channel-like forms grow. Moreover, the smallest wavelengths of perturbation in the y-direction grow fastest.

A modified (basic) model is constructed in which a non-zero lower bound on the wavelengths of unstable perturbations is assumed. The problem is to determine the evolution of N adjacent congruent valleys, with streams approximated by lines. Using stability theory, it is found that: 1. the model is indeterminate unless a law of lateral stream migration is assumed. 2. for two adjacent valleys with constant-angle side-slopes, there is a finite length, proportional to some power (>1) of the valley width, over which the valleys are stable with respect to each other, but beyond which one captures the other. A model for lateral migration is proposed by which a stream moves away from that side-slope down which comes the greater flux of sediment. Perturbing a stream with constant-angle side-slopes from a symmetrical condition, it is shown that: either 1. the stream is insensitive to small variations of sedi- ment influx from either bank, in which case it is neutral with respect to lateral movement and the N-valley problem is solved for the constant slope case; or 2. the stream is sensitive to such variations and is unstable with respect to such movement along its entire length.

As hypothesized Socio-economic Status, Family Status, and Minor Ethnic Status were among the most important factors to be identified. An oblique analysis proved these factors to be ""naturally"" orthogonal. After the temporal stability of the composition of similar fact- ors in each time period was established and an in- dication of factorial homogeneity and reliability was obtained, spatial change in urban structure was identified by the subtraction of factor scores for identical areas measured on compositionally similar but temporally separated factors. Two spatial characteristics, distribution and arrangement, were then examined with regard to- urban structure (1951 and 1961) and change.

As hypothesized a set of factors representing increasingly restricted urban distributions were identified. Analysis indicated these factors were also ""naturally"" orthogonal and compositionally stable through time, 1951-1961. A measure of factorial homogeneity and reliability also was obtained. Distributional change was identified by subtracting factor scores for identical areas measured on compositionally similar but temporally separated factors. These distributional characteristics of Montreal\'s urban space in 1951 and 1961 and their change were related to urban structure. An intercorrelation analysis of structure and distribution factors for 1951 and 1961 was carried out. As hypothesized the most closely related structure and distribution factors were those with similarity in variable and transformed variable composition. This was true despite the shifting of key urban structure variables to different variable associations in the distributional analysis, eg. , one of the major ethnic variables shifted from an urban structure socio-economic association to an urban distributional segregation association. A multiple-partial coefficient was calculated in order to examine the relationship between spatial change Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

These results indicate that the most impor- tant distributional change factor in explaining change in urban structure is the Male Labour Force Factor. Since this factor had already been linked to suburban characteristics these results support an early hypo- thesis concerning the importance of suburbanization in Montreal\'s urban structure between 1951 and 1961. Arrangement deals with the spatial pattern of structure factors in 1951 and 1961 and their change in urban space. The classical patterns of sectorial arrangement of Socio-economic Characteristics, of the zonal or ring arrangement of Family Characteristics, and of multiple-nuclei arrangement of Minority Char- acteristics are tested. The original factor scores for a given factor are correlated with a set of smoothed or filtered scores typical of a particular arrangement pattern.

As hypothesized Socio-economic Status is sectorial and Family Status is zonal in their static distributions, 1951 and 1961. However, the pattern of Socio-economic change is nucleated and the pattern of change in Family Status could not be distinguished. As expected Minor Ethnic Status is nucleated in its static and change characteristics. The overall importance of nucleation in the pattern of urban structure is a dominant finding. One heuristic result implies that where other studies, which did not utilize a nucleation measure, identify factors as inconclusive in their zonal versus sectorial pattern character this study classifies these factors as nucleated.

While none of these enterprises resulted in the establishment of a permanent colony in the New World, they merit study both because of what they reveal about English society at the time and because they are representative of the particular type of colonizing venture which predominated during the first years of European expansion overseas and as such shed some light upon the conditions that gave rise to that type of western planting. As may be inferred from the title, the emphasis in this dissertation is primarily on the role of those gentlemen adven- turers who led or planned to lead expeditions to the New World: specifically, Thomas Stuoley, Richard Grenville, Martin Frobisher, Humphrey Gilbert, Walter Ralegh, Christopher Carleill, Charles Leigh, and Bartholomew Gosnold. The first three of four chapters are devoted to a study of their career profiles, the sources of their self-images, and the relation between these self-images and their ideas on western planting. The decision to focus upon them was made after preliminary research suggested that, in con- trast perhaps to the situation in the Jacobean period, they not Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Just as in the private military expedition, where the sixteenth century planting project finds its closest structural analogue, the colonizer depended on a relatively small group of major associates - usually men who were members of his family or friends from his locality. Because ships, victuals, and addi- tional finanoial aid were needed, merchants naturally played a role in planting projects, but very soldom in the Elizabethan period were they the primary instigators of such projects or greatly involved in the planning. This is not to say that it is unimportant to examine the ancillary groups around the colonization leaders: the courtiers, local gentry, merchants, religious sects, and other groups who invested in these expeditions, wont on them or did both. The fourth chapter, therefore, is an analysis of how these Eliza- bethan enterprises were organized including an investigation of the known participants and an estimate of the money invested in these various projects. The conclusion attempts to make some comparisons between Elizabethen and Jacobean thinking on western planting and mercantile development. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

I have not attempted to choose only one or two aspects of this evolution but have instead given a general discussion of all the variations and changes in development from Cigoli\'s earliest works to those of his most mature period to establish his importance which has so often been misunderstood and neglected. I also felt that it was im- portant to briefly outline some background of the period from which Cigoli emerges, dealt with in the first chapter, in order to facilitate a general understanding of Florentine painting in the late sixteenth century. Around 1570, just before Cigoli came to Florence, a new style had begun to evidence itself-- style that was anti-""maniera. 11 It is to this manner of painting that Cigoli turns, seeking instruction from its leader, Santi di Tito.

Correggio is an exception to this general thesis, but his impact on Cigoli is, in the end, minimal. At no point is there evidence of any significant influence from either Federico Bar- occi or Titian, the two artists usually said to have played a decisive role in Cigoli\'s development. While spending the first active years of his career experimenting with a combination of, or fluctuation between, highly structured works (based on Tito) and poignantly per- sonal works (based on Pontormo), Cigoli begins to demonstrate, around 1593, the influence of his contemporaries - those artists who matured under similar conditions; Jacopo Ligozzi, Domenico Passignano and Jacopo da Empoli. It is from a comparison of Cigoli\'s paintings in this phase (in which he emulates his peers) to his paintings of the following period (wherein he masters his own unique qualities) that his individuality and creativity becomes clear.

This style is finally attained by the skillful union of structural clarity and rhythmic fluidity. In 1604, Cigoli left Florence for Rome where he remained, with intermittent visits to Florence, until his death in 1613. Both in terms of the commissions which he won and the style which he developed, Cigoli was a significant artist in Rome who contributed to the creation of a Baroque style. In the first few years, he exhibits a prodigious curiosity for the diversity of styles in Rome and, as a result, alters his Florentine manner considerably without loosing, however, its essential nature. While giving greater solidity to his figures and forming a stronger sense of unity in organization, he increases his sense of drama by heightening spontaneity through movement.

Instructions are represented as a pair of binary vectors, ^ d and e, which completely describe the sources and sinks specified by the instruction. Tasks are represented as square matrices, M, called. ordering matrices. The values of the elements of these matrices are used to dynamically indicate the necessary ordering of the exe- cution of instructions. It is shown Thow several different types of ordering matrices, each type having the capability of exhibiting different amounts of potential concurrency, can be calculated from the d and e vectors of the instructions of a task using ""linear algebraic-like"" operations. For example, inter-cycle independencies can be detected with a ternary ordering matrix. This matrix can be extended to dynamically detect opportunities for reassigning the resources specified by certain instructions to increase the amount of potential concurrency. Experimental results are presented showing the relative capa- bility of each of these matrix-types for exhibiting potential concur- rency. These techniques are shown to produce somewhat greater amounts of potential concurrency than other known dynamic techniques. However, the amounts of potential concurrency found are much less than those reported for preprocessing detection techniques. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The present investigation is a combined observational, experimental and theoretical examination of the role of small-scale waves and wind-drift riding on longer gravity waves. The experiments were carried out in a laboratory wind-wave tank. The wind tunnel fan speed was held constant, providing a mean windspeed at the center of the air channel of about 6 m/s. The mechanical wavemaker frequency was also held constant at 1.7 Hz and its stroke was incremented to provide carrier wave slopes (Ak) of 0.00, 0.03, D.C., 0.17 and 0.28. The characteristics of the short wave structure were documented photographically. Measurements were made of the mean wind profile and streamwise pressure gradient and of the vave amplitude at three fetches. The wave amplitude data was processed in the time and frequency domains using phase-averaging and Fourier analysis. Beyond a certain steepness, the carrier waves were observed to undergo a limiting process not previously described. This is best characterized as a rolling of the crest towards a stagnation point relative to the moving wave. The stagnation point was consistently observed ahead of the crest.

Its predictions for the onset of rolling were in close agreement with the experimental observations. The model also yielded qualitative information on the flux of short wave energy with respect to the carrier wave. This result is useful in understanding the previously observed (Mitsuyasu, 1966) phenomenon of the apparent total suppression of natural wind generated gravity wavelets which occurred as the carrier wave steepness was increased beyond a certain limit. Also included is a comprehensive account of the 'maser' mechanism of wind-wave generation proposed by Longuet-Higgins (1969b), a critical review of a paper by Hasselmann (1971) disclaining its viability and an alternate analysis of the coupling between a short wave field riding on a long finite amplitude gravity wave. As this analysis does not suffer from certain implicit fundamental assumptions inherent in Hasselmann's analysis, it is felt that it is a significant contribution towards a correct evaluation of the 'maser' mechanism.

441,,"wagman, stephen robert",ph.d.,literature,the living lyre: a study of the poetry of thomas gray,the johns hopkins university,1973,"[""ABSTRACT Underlying the usual division of Gray's poetry into classical and Celtic modes is a quality of profound ambivalence. On the one hand, he is disposed to believe that the circumstances in which man is nurtured, including but not limited to the classical and Celtic pasts, can both cause and correct what ails his spirit. But on the other hand, with equal conviction he tends to feel that man's spirit, while a prey to the influence of circumstances, bene- ficial and harmful, need not and should not be determined by this influence. The former inclination leads him to survey a wide variety of conditions in life, from the classical and Celtic civilizations to mountains and plains and youth and age. In everything he considers he invariably finds qualities that both foster man's spirit and paralyze or dissipate it. The fertility of the Mediterranean soil and the warmth of its climate, for example, are seen as responsible at the same time for the flowering of Roman civilization and for the luxury and indolence that made it vulnerable to the barbarian hordes from the north. The harsh life, in turn, of these invaders is seen as the major factor in molding both their brutality and their indomitable spirit. Because of the paradoxical nature of these gentle and fierce spirits, which govern every condition of life he investigates, Gray cannot ultimately decide whether circum- stances that foster the one or the other are more favorable to ful- fillment and happiness. When Gray's inclination leads him to feel that man need not depend on any circunstances for his spirit to thrive, he writes his most defiant and sublime poetry. Instead of surveying the world with philosophical detachment or feverish anxiety, he looks down on it with lofty and dignified contempt. In this mood he expresses faith in the power of man's spirit to forge a noble destiny for it- self, whether it must sustain the adversity of a barren soil and cold climate or the forces of political tyranny. But this attitude of Gray's is only occasional. Although he approves of it almost without reservation, he cannot depend on it as he would like to. He himself is too much a prey to what he considers to be the be- nighted circumstances of his own age to have unwavering faith in the self-reliant vigor of the soul. Instead he remains locked in an unresolved conflict between the tendency to believe in the power of circumstances and the inclination to spurn them in favor of the spirit's capacity to determine itself.""]"

I also discovered that previously discussed subjects were often treated in a supe- rior manner in the later volumes.

I studied the nine volumes of the collection and made a catalogue of many recurring images and themes. Finally I selected the following topics with the intention of analysing their chronologi- cal development: the colors of autumn, the symbo- lism of the falling leaves, sensory worship of God, the circle in the dot, and the Chain of Being. Invariably the comparison between the analo- gous poems in the earlier and in the later volumes prove the later poems to be superior. The results demonstrate that Brockes' poetic insight and pure artistry developed to a high level and occasionally reached a perfection we do not expect to find until the classical age. It is hoped that through a more adequate knowledge of the best of the poet's work the myth of Brockes' poetic decline will disappear from the literary histories.

Title: Animal Imagery in the Old Testament: Some Aspects of Hebrew Poetics A doctoral thesis submitted in the Department of Near Eastern Studies, The Johns Hopkins University, 1972. For the purpose of this study in the imagery of Old Testament poetry, the corpus of animal imagery has been chosen as an easily definable and manageable body of material, represented in all periods of Hebrew poetry and in the majority of the books of the Old Testament. Expectations for the elucidation of this material has traditionally been set on the efforts of students of natural history. The present study is written in the conviction that attention to literary form, style and convention is just as helpful, if not even more so, to the interpreter of the Biblical text. The thesis explores the varicties of relationship between some known forms of Hebrew verse structure, particularly parallelismus membrorum, and the vocabu- lary of poetic imagery. In casting his imagery in the most common denominators of Hebrew poetry, the single bi-colon and double bi-colon, the poet evidences clear Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. ii patterns in the choice of his vocabulary. These pat- terns are detailed in the ""Conclusions"" of the study. Though considerably less material is available that extends beyond the double bi-colon, certain observa- tions governing the structuring of the imagery may be made in these cases also. Attendant problems in any study of Hebrew poetry are likewise dealt with in the thesis, not the least among them being the difficulty of translation itself. Some of the passages involved are cruces of translation and are treated at some length. In certain cases new solutions to translation and meaning are offered, and in other instances the results of the present study lend heavy support to one proposal out of the many heretofore offered. The conventionality of much animal imagery emerges clearly. When certain animal imagery is utilized by various authors at widely different times and places, the point of comparison is relatively constant, and often much of the detail as well. This principle of conventionality may thus be applied in the investiga- tion of passages of heretofore contested meaning and often permits a solution to the meaning and import of certain Biblical passages. Such constants of imagery are the use of certain groupings of animals to form Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

These literary conventions can in some cases be shown to extend beyond Hebrew literature to the litera- tures of neighboring Semitic speaking peoples of the ancient Near East. This observation is naturally im- portant for the interpreter of the Old Testament and gives insight not only into the meaning of individual passages but has implications for the literary standing of the various authors of Old Testament poetry and their schooling in the literatures of the ancient world. One observation running throughout the study is a testing of a dictum that is familiar to all students of the literature of the Old Testament, namely, that Hebrew imagery is ""concrete"" as opposed to being ""ab- stract."" Our study indicates quite the opposite. It is here maintained that the so-called ""concrete imagery"" of Hebrew poetry functions as a true abstrac- tion by virtue of its conventional nature, and hence evokes from the hearer and reader a complex of refer- ence extending far beyond the detail offered in any particular case.

444,,"borukhov, eliyahu",ph.d.,economics,"city size, land use and transportation costs.",the johns hopkins university,1972,"['Abstract or Oné of the major advances in the understanding of the internal structure of cities and metropolitan areas in the last decade, was the publication of several studies which established a family of urban models in the tradition of Von Thünen. The pioneers of this approach were Lowdon Wingo, (1961) and William Alonso (1964). The main hypothesis, which lies at the center of these models, is that the degree of accessibility from every location to the center of the city is a major determinant of the internal spatial structure of a city; and that the degree of accessibility could be measured by the distance from the center. The theory was refined in the hands of Mills (1967 and 1969) and Muth (1969). They have also tested the implications of their models against data on land values and density of land use. Their tests tend, by and large, to confirm the theory as an approximation to reality. The purpose of my work is to continue the theoretical analysis of these writers. One purpose of the extension is to look for more testable implications of the theory. For that purpose I have tried several versions and modifications of the basic models that were suggested by those writers. i Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. In Chapter II, I present one. such model. I interpret that model as a model of a city where time (and other variable costs) are only costs of transpor- tation. For that model I calculated total transportation costs as a function of city size. The results of these calculations are then tested against data on the amount of time that people spend on travel in 34 cities (of various sizes). The results tend - in my judgement - to add credibility to the theory which is represented in this work. Chapter III is devoted to an effort to derive from another version of the model implications about the proportion of land allocated to transportation. Two propositions are derived: One is that the proportion of land devoted to transportation should decline with distance from the center to the edge of the city. This is confirmed by data on the proportion of land used for streets and roads in a number of cities. The second proposition is that the proportion of land devoted to transportation should increase with city size. The empirical data give weak evidence in favor of this proposition. Chapter IV and V are devoted exclusively to theoretical analysis. Chapter IV surveys the theory of ii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The literature on local public goods seems to have ignored the role that land rents can play in the efficient use of space. Attention is called to this aspect of the problem. The results of this chapter can also be interpreted as a theoretic definition of the concept of an optimal city size. Chapter V is devoted to an analysis of the effects of the property tax. Again these effects are analysed within the context of a model that was developed in previous chapters. The conclusions of this chapter confirm some of the conclusions of the literature on the property tax (such as ivetzer (1966) ) . But in addition the spatial effects of the property tax (on land values and density in different parts of cities) are derived. It is shown that even with uniform rates, the property tax tends to encourage the intensive use of land in the suburbs and to raise its price, at the expense of land values near the center of a city. iii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Although the concept of collective rationality is central to choice theory and logically prerequisite to policy formation, adequate definition is lacking. The purpose of this study is to clarify some leading problems encountered in the attempt to definitively interpret this concept. The approach is to propose two conditions for rationality of social choice and to assess the possibility of satisfying them in light of results achieved in the literature. The conditions are that individual preferences must acceptably aggregate to a social ordering of social states and that a decision procedure must exist which reliably selects the optimum state, The consistency of a choice mechanism does not imply reliability if individual choice is made under uncertainty or if social choice proceeds by a sequence of decisions on separate issues, particularly when the issues are interdependent, Therefore, consistency of social choices bears no normative significance, and must be distin- guished from transitivity of the social preference struc- ture, which does. ii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. Market behavior does not permit inference of a social preference ordering. Market rules become especi- ally unreliable in the presence of second-best problems, externality, and public goods. Non-market choice pro- cedures must supplement market rules in order both to identify and achieve an optimum. Arrow has questioned the consistency of any choice system which satisfics several value-conditions obeyed by market rules. His theorem is applicable to rules for aggregation of choice orderings, preference order- ings of either social states or decision rules, and to the consistency of decision procedures. Evaluation of the theorem requires recognition that the ethical vali- dity of the value-conditions varies with the particular application involved. The independence of irrelevant alternatives may be sacrificed by allowing vote-trading to account for preference intensity.

Neither does the mere existence of a social ordering guarantee reliability of the choice process. Satisfaction of the rationality conditions appears unlikely. Collective rationality might alternatively be interpreted as the use of decision rules which relia- bly account for such consensus as does exist, even in the absence of a social ordering of states. Vote-trading might be allowed to generate consistency on issues lacking consensus so long as decisions so achieved are consistent with outcomes reached by consensus. Thus different value-conditions may be appropriately relaxed at different stages of the decision process; one condition need not be sacrificed for decisions of all types. If such a procedure, evaluated in terms of its properties, commands sufficient consensus, Arrow's theorem is solved at the level of constitutional choice and conflicts as to outcomes achieved by the process may be taken as optimally resolved. iv Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

This technique utilizes the microscopic observation of the topography produced by the microstructure on a free surface of a .25 mm thick foil, which is suspended on an oblong wire loop. Directional growth is obtained by electrically heating one end of the wire loop. For the Pb-Sn-Cd ternary eutectic, information regarding the motion of the liquid-solid interface and the Pb-rich and Sn- rich lamellae is recorded cinemicrographically. Metallographic sectioning of the foils after solidification shows no sign of microstructural differences between the interior and the ex- terior of the foil. This technique is applied to the study of the un- steady solidification of the Pb-Sn-Cd ternary eutectic. It is well known that changes in solidification velocity have a pro- found effect on inter-lamellar spacing; but the dynamics of such effects have not been documented. In the present work, it is found that the lamellar spacing does not begin to change until the ratio of the interface velocity to the initial (steady) velocity reaches a critical value. This critical value depends heavily on the uniformity of the lamellar struc- ture. Also when the final steady interface velocity is more than four times the initial steady velocity, the lameller spacing does not decrease uniformly in time but decreases in iii stages. It was also found that after a velocity change from one steady value to another the product XV does not return to its original value. A steady state theory of ternary lamel- lar solidification is formulated and used as a basis for a dis- cussion of the non-steady results.']"

But perhaps more impor- tant than his formal education was the one he received at home from his father, John William Draper. Henry was taken into his father's confidence in all scientific matters, and was intellectually stimulated by him. Although trained in medicine, it was in astronomy that he made his greatest achievements and earned his international reputation. Draper introduced the silvered-glass reflecting tele- scope to Americans in 1864 through a highly successful Smithsonian Institution publication which became an important landmark in the history of telescope making. He was one of the earliest and most successful persons to exploit the photo- graphic possibilities of large telescopes, obtaining excellent lunar photographs in 1863 and the first photograph of a ne- bula in 1880. Besides direct celestial photography, Draper also pioneered in spectrum photography. In 1872 he obtained the first photograph of a stellar spectrum which showed Fraunhofer lines. The following year he took an unrivaled diffraction- spectrum photograph of the sun in order to prepare a trust- worthy map of the solar lines. After serving for three months Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. iv as Director of the Photographic Department of the Transit of Venus Commission in 1874, he returned to his spectrum photo- graphy investigations. The summer of 1877 was probably one of the most ex- citing ever for Draper--it was marked by his alleged dis- covery of a third satellite of Mars (along with Edward S. Holden) and his presentation of a paper before the American Philosophical Society describing his alleged discovery of oxygen in the sun and a new theory of the solar spectrum. According to this theory, oxygen discloses itself in the solar spectrum not by the familiar dark Fraunhofer lines, but by bright lines. Many spectroscopists, however, were hesitant to drastically alter their ground rules, and a controversy arose amongst the leading scientists of America and Europe which went unsettled for nearly two decades. Most of the opposition came from some members of the Royal Astronomical Society. Draper went there in 1879 to present some high-dispersion photographs he had taken. But, probably due more to a division within the Society which cen- tered around J. Norman Lockyer than to the merits of his new photographs, Draper failed to convince everyone present at the meeting, and his presentation only sharpened the debate. Draper's plans at the time of his death in 1882 were twofold: 1) to continue to examine the solar spectrum to see if he could discover any other nonmetals in it besides oxygen, Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. V and 2) to catalogue and classify the stars according to their spectra by means of photography. Both of these lines of in- vestigation were carried out by other astronomers - - the former resulted in the eventual discovery of oxygen absorption lines in the solar spectrum by Carl David Tol.me Runge and Friedrich Paschen in 1896, the latter resulted in the Henry Draper Me- morial. Although highly regarded in his day by leading scien- tific figures, he is now often condescendingly characterized as a mere amateur. In a sense, of course, he was, but it is clear he was something more. For whereas many of his contem- porary professional astronomers did not leave the traditional boundaries of classical astronomy, Draper was in the fore- front of research in the new astronomy--astrophysics. It is for this reason that his scientific work deserves greater attention than it has hitherto received. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The first activity studied is governmental services such as schools and libraries. Three models are developed to determine the impact of changes in transport cost, demand, and production cost on the size and spacing of services. In an illustrative calculation surprisingly high imputed transportation cost for children traveling to school in Boston is uncovered. The second activity considered is retailing services. A model developed earlier by Mills and Lev is used to study the effect of transport cost, demand, production cost and population density on retail prices within a city. In the context of this model high population densities are found to be a source of high prices. The third activity considered is the location of residents around a central business district. The relation- ship between the type of transportation system and the locational pattern is studied in the context of a general equilibrium model. In particular, the impact of a subway system on a city and the benefits from such an improvement in the transportation system are considered.

450,,"dussan v., elizabeth b.",ph.d.,mechanical engineering,on the motion of a line common to three different materials,the johns hopkins university,1972,"['Abstract When the interface between two immiscible fluids meets a solid wall (e.g. air, water, and glass in a partially filled glass of water), a line common to all three materials is formed. This study examines, from a continuum point of view, the mo- tion of the fluid in the neighborhood of a moving common line. In several experiments performed in this study utilizing various fluids, it has been observed that fluid points initially on the fluid-fluid interface are transported to the common line in a finite amount of time. Such motion for viscous fluids would seem impossible for two reasons: (i) The very idea of a moving common line seems to imply a violation of the no slip boundary condition. (ii) Solid boundaries are usually thought of as fluid material surfaces. Proofs in the literature of such a statement are shown in this study to be either incorrect due to the use of an incomplete mathematical modelling of the definition of a material surface or incomplete due to high degree of smoothness assumed for the motion of the fluids. Theoretical consequences of the above mentioned experi- mental observation are investigated. It can be shown that if the fluid in contact with the rigid boundary does not slip, then there must exist a multi-valued velocity field at the common line, and in fact, the normal component of the velocity Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

All this is shown to be possible without violating the basic concepts of a continuum and of a bounding surface. These results are inde- o pendent of any assumptions about the constitutive equation of the bulk fluids (e.g. Newtonian, non-Newtonian, viscoelastic) and independent of any jump conditions on the free interface (e.g. surface tension, surface viscosity, surface elasticity) . Thus, the result is valid even for contaminated interfaces. In fact, there need not exist even a distinct mathematical interface. It is only sufficient that a fluid point in the interfacial region be transported onto the bounding wall in a finite amount of time and that there be no slip. If, in addition, the fluids are assumed to be incom- pressible, then it is shown theoretically that there exists at least one surface (other than the fluid-fluid interface), which coincides with trajectories of fluid points originating from the common line and extending into one of the fluids. This surface has been observed experimentally in this study. In order to be able to make quantitative predictions of the motion of the fluid (e.g. the velocity of the common line, the shape of the interface) it is necessary to make constitu- tive assumptions about the fluids and wall. It was decided to consider Newtonian incompressible fluids and a rigid bounding wall. However, it is proven in this study that such materials give use to an infinite force on the wall: Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

A sensitive pressure transducer was used to measure the pressure gradient along an experimental tube when various red cell suspensions passed through glass and plastic capillary tubes. In particular, the effect of capillary tube diameter on the rheological properties of blood was observed for capillary tube diameters from 8 to 221 microns. For tubes of 221 microns and smaller, it was found that the hematocrit (volume fraction of red cells in a blood sample) of the blood flowing through a capillary tube is less than the hematocrit of the blood in the feed reservoir. The tube hematocrit decreases linearly with the logarithm of the tube diameter at constant feed reservoir hematocrit and for a given diameter tube, increases lin- early with the feed reservoir hematocrit. An equation was developed from data taken in an 811-micron ID tube that allows the shear stress-shear rate relation to be predicted from the tube diameter, tube hematocrit, and the temperature. It was found that the rheological properties of blood can be accurately predicted from the equation developed if the average hematocrit inside the capillary tube is used as the correct hemato- iv crit parameter. A surprising result found is that fluid properties can be predicted for blood flow through a 29-micron ID tube; in such a tube, the equation of motion may not be valid because the ""continu- ous fluid"" assumption is not valid. Blood flow datawere taken at 98.6°F as well as 73.5°F. Blood heated to 111°F and then cooled to 98.6°F was also investigated. Blood flow through 15- and 9-micron ID capillaries was in- vestigated. Blood exhibits no yield stress in a 15-micron ID tube because rouleaux formation cannot restrict the flow as it does in larger tubes. An increased yield stress was found in a 9-micron ID tube. The measured shear stress was only slightly larger (for a given U) than predicted by the continuum model in both the 15- and 9-micron ID capillary tubes.']"

One is the limiting procedure of the finite dimensional description of partial differential equation systems along the spatial axis, applying known filter equations in ordinary differential equation systems.

A neutrally- buoyant tracer was injected continuously at ambient velocity through a small round source at a point within the flow. Tracer concentra- tion was measured in situ at several points downstream of the source using conductivity probes. Tracer concentration was analyzed in two phases. In Phase I, time-averaged concentration was evaluated, its distribution within the plume determined, and characteristic coef- ficients of transverse mixing calculated. It was shown that the transverse mixing coefficient varied with the flow level and was highest near the water surface where the flow velocity was greatest. In contrast to previous speculation, the ratio of the depth-averaged coefficient of transverse mixing D2 to the product of the (bed) shear velocity and the flow depth d was not a constant but depended on the aspect ratio A = d/w, where W = flume width. For laboratory experiments P2/ugd decreased from 0.24 to 0.093 as A increased from 0.015 to 0.200. In Phase II, the temporal fluctuation of tracer concentration was studied in three sections. In the first, the intermittency factor technique was used to delineate three regions of the plume cross section: an inner core where tracer concentration c(t) was always greater than the background Cbi an intermittency region where c(t) was only intermittently greater than CB; and the outer region -V- where cb was never exceeded. Dimensional analysis furnished universal curves for prediction of the geometric characteristica of the three regions. In the second section, the entire plume, at a fixed station, was treated as a fluctuating cloud. Variances characterizing the fluctuation of the plume centroid and the variation of the plume width were calculated and compared. In the third section, the intensity and probability density of the concentration fluctuations at fixed points were calculated. The distribution of the peak-to-average ratio was also determined. Finally the results of the two phases of study were inter- related to evaluate their contributions to the transverse spreading of the plume.']"

Tests for Helicity Conservation and Spin-Parity Selection Rules in Diffraction Dissociation A phenomenological discussion of diffraction dissociation is presented in which the development of experimental tests for its con- jectured properties is emphasized. Of particular interest is the problem of distinguishing between the behavior of resonances and background. Simple tests for the helicity, spin-parity, and internal quantum number selection rules proposed for resonance production would be possible only if the nonresonant background were absent. These would include an isotropy in azimuthal angle test for helicity conservation and a symmetry under parity inversion test for the Chou- Yang and Carlitz-Frautschi-Zweig rules. The more general and realis- tic case is that in which nonresonant background is present as well as resonances. It is found that a nonresonant pion exchange mechanism can account for the production characteristics of the broad low mass enhancements seen in present diffraction dissociation data. These include the variation of momentum transfer dependence with in- variant mass and the spin-parity of the enhancements. It is unlikely that this background obeys the selection rules expected of resonance production. Nevertheless, the rapid variation in phase and possibly high spins of resonance contributions when interfered with the slow variation in phase and predominantly low spins expected of a pion exchange contribution should make possible tests for resonance pro- duction selection rules given adequate statistics.

Independent Production of Pions We investigate theoretical limitations on the possibility that multiparticle experiments at high energies are dominated by the independent production of uncorrelated pions. A description of pion production in coherent states is developed in order to systematically study the effects of conservation laws. Charge conservation leads to modifications of Poisson distributions for charged particle production in purely hadronic reactions that agree well with experiment. Other + systems such as e e pions are so limited by charge conjugation considerations that production of uncorrelated pions is ruled out. A formalism for the isospin analysis of pions with identical momentum distributions is developed and applied to coherent states. The fixed phase of a coherent state is important for minimizing the increase of <I2> with <n> The minimum that can be achieved with independent uncorrelated pions is a random walk in isospace. In this case the dominant contributions at present multiplicites come from the lowest isospins so that independent and coherent pions can be an approximation to experiment. Finally, the role of two pion correlations is studied. Independent emission of isoscalar pairs of pions solves the isospin problem and gives reasonable distributions of charged pions, but leads to negative correlations between charged and neutral pions that seriously disagree with experiment. Emission of charged isovector pairs of pions would improve the agreement with the observed slightly positive corre- lations. It is concluded that the effects of the many possible corre- lations may be difficult to resolve in the present analysis of existing data. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

It is an electrical fluctuation which exhibits itself as one or more rec- tangular waveforms possessing constant amplitude but random pulse duration. The experimental portion of this study relates only to burst noise in bipolar transistors and operational amplifiers. Burst noise is not Gaussian as are the more common fluctuations in semiconductors. That fact was established by estimation of the amplitude distribution, a technique found to be sensitive in the detection of burst noise obscured by quantities of conventional noise. The amplitude of burst noise varies with the parameters of base-emitter voltage, temperature, and source resistance. An exponential increase of amplitude with Vbe and a lack of dependence on collector voltage implied that the noise originates in the base-emitter junction. A noise magnitude linearly proportional to source resistance over several decades leads one to infer the equivalent circuit of a current source between and Current amplitudes of 10 -10 to nearly 10 -6 base emitter. ampere p-p were observed. Burst noise pulse durations were found as brief as 10 |sec and as long as some 29 hours; neither an upper nor a lower bound was established. The two noise states (high and low, in the rectangular waveform) were treated separately in the duration experiments. Careful measurements on the relative frequency with which the pulse occurred t gave duration probability densities e for each state. T Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

V That density also applies to a single particle alternately being trapped and escaping and is consistent with the physical theory due to Mead and Whittier relating burst noise to trapping phenomena. Measurements on noise pulse durations in both states as a function of `be lent support to the theory and indicated both trapping and recombination-generatior centers were present in samples examined. Another theory, due to Leonard and Jaskolsky, was found inconsistent with the evidence for burst noise's origin in the base-emitter junction. Duration versus temperature dependence indicated activation energies of roughly .5 eV. Although suggestions in the literature for the power spectrum of burst noise have been inconsistent, digital spectral estimation and judicious use of a wave analyzer showed the spectrum to be flat at low frequencies and to fall as 1/£² at higher ones. Proceeding only from the measured pulse duration probability density, the power spectrum was deduced on theoretical grounds for the first time. The method entailed the derivation of burst noise's autocorrelation function which, when Fourier transformed, yielded 2 s(w) = where T1 and To are the average durations in the two noise states.

In addition, several associated problems raised by this study are also explored in some detail. Surface wave dispersion and P-wave travel time delays are measured to delineate the crust and upper mantle structure in the Imperial Valley-Gulf of California region. Crustal thicknesses beneath Baja California and Sonora are comparable and near 25 km, while within the Gulf crustal structure varies laterally from nearly oceanic on the western side to continental shelf thicknesses -20 km) towards the north and east. Love wave group velocities for Baja California paths are unusually high and were not used to determine structure. P. and tele- n seismic P-wave delays are used in a reconnaissance survey of crustal structure in the Imperial Valley and across the Peninsular Range batholith. The data are consistent with an increase in crustal thickness of 12 km from flank to crest in the Peninsular Ranges, and a decrease of 8 km across the Imperial Valley. The high Love wave group velocities measured across Baja California are shown to be similar to velocities of the first higher mode. It is also demonstrated that higher Love modes can have group velocities very close to fundamental mode velocities for a range of wave periods and realistic earth models.

An important conclusion of this study is that anomalously high Love wave phase velocities reported for the United States midcontinent and Japan are straightforwardly explained by mode interference without appealing to complex or anisotropic models, as had been done previously. Seismic processes associated with actively spreading oceanic rises are examined in the study of a strong swarm of earthquakes located near an inferred spreading center in the Northern Gulf of California. Close-in travel time data constrain the origin times of swarm events and demonstrate that the epicenters are confined to the upper crust. Teleseismic P-delays suggest unusually low seismic velocities beneath the source. The previously suspected normal faulting nature of swarm earthquakes is also confirmed. Seismic coupling across 200 km between adjacent spreading centers in the Northern Gulf is indicated by a survey of recent seismicity. It is noted in the study of the Gulf swarm that these sources have significantly higher surface wave amplitudes than events with similar assigned magnitudes in Northern Baja California. In the final chapter of this thesis a detailed analysis is made of the Baja earthquakes and it is concluded that as a group they have distinctly smaller source dimen- sions and larger stress drops than events within the Gulf of California. These differences are quite marked and are often very clearly seen even on records from band-limited seismographs. Several examples exist where propagation paths are very similar but the visual appearance of records differs considerably, suggesting that near-source or path Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

A central result of this theory is the following expression for the nonlinear polarization L3(t) in terms of the electric field E(t), the ""electronic"" parameter o and the ""nuclear response functions"" a(t) and b(t): + / a(t-T)E(T).E(T)dTE(t) + In the theory the relationship between these parameters and the nonlinear susceptibility tensor 3 is established.

Although the interpretation of these results along with Kerr, three-wave mixing, and third harmonic generation data nominally indicate that c >> ß for glasses, we hesitate to conclude that the nonlinear refractive indices in glasses are purely ""electronic"" in origin until the uncertainties in the latter measurements are reduced. If it is assumed however that electronic contributions are dominant, these experi- mental data would indicate that the nonlinear refractive ind: n2 for a linearly polarized beam in fused quartz, BK-7 glass, and SF-7 glass is -13 1.2, 1.7, and 6.9 x 10 esu respectively. Parallel investigations of ""ellipse rotation"" in the symmetric molecule liquid CC12 show that X 1221 (-w,w,w,-w) = 6.1 x 10 -15 esu. 3 This value when interpreted along with very accurate Kerr measurements indicate that the fractional electronic contribution to the Kerr constant 0 of CC14 is given by - 0.54 + 0.17. Hence both electronic and o+B nuclear contributions are significant to nonlinear refractive index changes in CC14° Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Simple analytical expressions in terms of the circuit components are derived for the characteristic transient and frequency responses of averaged power-stage models for use in designing and understanding the behavior of the actual switched power stages. High-order systems can be analyzed by the aver- aging technique without a commensurate increase in complexity. Two functional blocks are necessary to construct a switched con- verter: the switch controller, which is relatively well understood, and the power stage. When concreteness is necessary, a particular pulse- width modulator is chosen for the switch controller and is thoroughly analyzed. The output of representative power stages (buck, boost, and buck-boost) is a complicated nonlinear function of the switch controller and source input, and since conventional methods of nonlinear analysis are shown to be intractable or uninterpretable, attention is focused on the challenge of obtaining useful design equations. The difficulty encountered in the nonlinear analysis of switched power stages is successfully surmounted by the semiheuristic development of a continuous power-stage model. Since the characteristic response times of state variables in the switched power stage are invariably large with respect to the switching period, discontinuous forcing functions in the equivalent circuits are averaged over a time interval comparable with the switching period without appreciably affecting the nature of Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Equivalent circuits and analytic expressions for the transient and frequency response of each power-stage type are then derived from the averaged models. A linear- ized control-input transfer function, obtained for small amplitude variations of the averaged control, reveals a dependence of effective circuit component values upon the switch duty ratio, and the possible existence of a positive real zero. The unusual behavior predicted above is confirmed by an analog computer simulation of both the switched and averaged power stages. It is also shown experimentally that closed-loop stability of the switched power stage is adequately predicted by the averaged model. The averag- ing technique is thus a powerful analytical tool for exposing inherent characteristics of switched circuits. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

ABSTRACT The experimental portion of this thesis tries to estimate the density of the power spectrum of very low frequency semiconductor noise, -6.3 from 10 cps to 1. cps with a greater accuracy than that achieved in previous similar attempts: it is concluded that the spectrum is 1/20 with a approximately 1.3 over most of the frequency range, but appear- ing to have a value of about 1 in the lowest decade. The noise sources are, among others, the first stage circuits of a grounded input silicon epitaxial operational amplifier. This thesis also investigates a pecu- liar form of stationarity which seems to distinguish flicker noise from other semiconductor noise. In order to decrease by an order of magnitude the pernicious effects of temperature drifts, semiconductor ""aging"", and possible mechanical failures associated with prolonged periods of data taking, 10 independent noise sources were time-multiplexed and their spectral estimates were subsequently averaged. If the sources have similar spectra, it is demonstrated that this reduces the necessary data-taking time by a factor of 10 for a given accuracy. In view of the measured high temperature sensitivity of the noise sources, it was necessary to combine the passive attenuation of a special-material container with active control. The noise sources were placed in a copper-epoxy container of high heat capacity and medium heat conductivity, and that container was immersed in a temperature con- trolled circulating ethylene-glycol bath. vi Other spectra of interest, estimated from data taken concurrently with the seniconductor noise data were the spectra of the bath\'s con- trolled temperature, the semiconductor surface temperature, and the power supply voltage amplitude fluctuations. A brief description of the equip- ment constructed to obtain the d\'orementioned data is included. The analytical portion of this work is concerned with the follow- ing questions: what is the best final spectral density estimate given 10 statistically independent ones of varying quality and magnitude? How can the Blackman and Tukey algorithm which is used for spectral estima- tion in this work be improved upon? How can non-equidistant sampling reduce data processing cost? Should one try to remove common trands shared by supposedly statistically independent noise sources and, if so, what are the mathematical difficulties involved? What is a physically plausible mathematical model that can account for flicker noise and what are the mathematical implications on its statistical properties Finally, the variance of the spectral estimate obtained through the Blackman/Tukey algorithm is analyzed in greater detail; the variance is shown to diverge for a 1 in an assumed power spectrum of k/1/16, unless the assumed spectrum is ""truncated"".']"

Spatial resolution was 2 minutes of arc; velocity resolution was 21 km-s-1. The data yield infor- mation on the distribution of the HI, and its associated velocity field. Hydrogen extent of the objects agrees well with their optical size, and evidences a lumpy structure. HI peaks occur away from the nuclei for NGC2403 and NGC4236, and are suggestive of a ring structure for the former galaxy. The hydrogen distribution of IC10 is similar in appearance to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud. In all objects HI peaks show good positional agreement with major HII regions. Velocity fields are derived for all objects, and rotation curves obtained for NGC2403 and NGC4236. These curves evidence differential rotation but do not include Keplerian tails, implying that the mass distributions are considerably extended and the total masses poorly determined. The velocity field of IC10 suggests rotation. Non-circular motions of ~10 km-s-- are seen in NGC2403, and these agree well with the streaming motions predicted by the density-wave theory of spiral structure.

The experimental system consisted of a small water tunnel with a test section in which single fibers were inserted. The deposition rate of particles under conditions of controlled flow and chemical composition was measured with an optical microscope. Particles studied included human erythrocytes and latex spheres rang- ing in size from 2.0 um polyvinyltoluene latex to 25.7 um styrene- divinylbenzene copolymer latex. The fibers were composed of glass, fluoroethylene-propylene (teflon - FEP), and cellulose acetate. Surface chemistry was found to play a major role in the attachment of micron- size particles to the collector. However, electrical double layer theory could not predict the onset of rapid particle attachment quanti- tatively. Significant viscous interaction of particles approaching the collector surface was inferred from the data, confirming recent theory A novel application of hollow fibers with permeable membrane walls was developed. The membrane permeability permits modification of the fiber suspension interface by means of chemical addition and flow alteration. The destabilizing chemicals form a thin Cuncentra- tion boundary layer around the fiber surface, reducing the total amount of chemical needed. Slight suction at the fiber surface reduces the hydrodynamic resistance acting on the particles as they approach the surface. An increase in the collection efficiency can occur when these methods are applied.']"

These models are useful in the analysis of elastic structures exposed to a steady fluid flow. An asymptotic method, based on the approximation of Bogoliubov and Mitropolsky, is developed for the analysis of the autonomous, internally resonant, nonlinear differential equations produced by the models. It is shown that the solutions of these systems can be divided into two classes by the nature of the secular terms arising in the perturbation equations. A model for multi-degree-of-freedom galloping is developed by modeling the aerodynamic forces on the structure as dependent only on the relative magnitude and velocity of the flow to the structure. A simple criterion for the stability of the zero solution is presented. Examples are made with a noninertially coupled system with the torsion and plunge degrees-of-freedom and a cubic curve fit to the aerodynamic coefficients. Examples show that the system is dominated by either a torsion or a plunge mode except when the natural frequencies of these modes are in certain integer multiples. In these cases the two modes interact strongly and they achieve first order limit cycles simultaneously. A model for vortex induced vibration of elastic structures is produced from a control volume approach to the vortex shedding process. The model features both fluid and structural oscillators.

Suppose that a set C consisted of convex sets in R1, and that for any choice of n + 1 sets in C the n + 1 sets had a point in common. Then Helly\'s theorem states that any finite number of sets in C have a common point. (n+1) is known as the Helly number of convex sets in R1. One may ask if unions of k convex sets have a similar Helly\'s number. This paper puts convexity in the abstract, and imposes conditions on a set A (consisting of sets that are unions of k convex sets) such that A can be shown to have a Helly\'s number. This paper also considers an abstraction of the notion of ""polygonally connected sets"" from an abstract convexitist\'s point of view. In showing that certain sets of unions of convex sets have an a Helly\'s number, a special case of a generalized pigeon hole principle is used. This paper also proves two generalized pigeon hole principles, and in many cases gives the best possible results. Both generalized pigeon hole principles make the following assumptions on a matrix A: (1) there are n rows (2) each row has at most l zero\'s (3) every submatrix of A, that does not have any zero entries, has at most k distinct (not identical) rows (4) that numbers h and/or t are given. One generalized pigeon hole principle states there exists a function xa(h, k, l) such that if n > xa(h,k,! then there must exist some h + 1 iv columns such that along every row of the matrix those h + 1 columns have the same entry with possibly l exceptions. The other generalized pigeon hole principle states that there exists a function xe(h, k, l, t) such that if n > xe(h, k, l, t), then there must exist some sh +t (s > 0) columns that can be partitioned into S sets of columns such that it is possible to make suitable changes to the zero entries in each of these sh +t columns in order to make those S sets of columns into s sets of equal columns. It is also shown that for certain values of h, k, l, and t that xa(h, k,l) = hk +1 and xe(h, k, l, t) = kh +t + (k-1).

Antennas of the Owens Valley Radio Obser- vatory (California), the Harvard Radio Astronomy Station (Texas), and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (West Virginia) were used to give three baselines that greatly im- proved the (u,v)-plane coverage compared to the coverage of previously used single baselines. The three baselines had 6 lengths of 119, 84, and 54x10 1. The observed sources were 3C 84, NRAO 150, OJ 287, 4C 39.25, 3C 273, PKS 2134+004, and VRO 42.22.01 (BL Lac) . They were tracked by all three antennas during the time of mutual visibility, giving 8 to 11.5 hours of continuous 6 coverage. With the maximum baseline of 119x10 A and a u-v cell size of r40x10 6 A, it is unlikely that we have missed any important structure information in the range 0.0005 to 0.005. Fourier inversion of the observations was impossible because there was no phase calibration, and model fitting procedures were used to interpret the data. For five of the sources (NRAO 150, OJ 287, 4C 39.25, 3C 273, and VRO 42.22.01) Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

For 3C 84 and PKS 2134+004 no simple model could be found, but a rough idea of the source structure was still possible. For most of the sources, interferometric results at other fre- quencies and resolutions are consistent with the present findings, and a joint interpretation is given. For all the sources except OJ 287 (which looks like a point source at our resolution and was used to calibrate the correlated flux density scale) and possibly NRAO 150, two or more separate components are required to match the observa- tions. Component separations range from 0.0006 to 0.005 and their sizes from <0.0003 to ^0.002. Components less than 20""002 contribute 0.85 or more of the total 10.7 GHz flux density for all the sources. Assuming synchrotron self- absorbed components, the magnetic fields in the compact -3=1 sources are ^10 gauss. This value is less than the equi- partition field, and the individual components are expected to expand from particle pressure.

In Part I the nonlinear oscillations of a spherical gas bubble in an incompressible, viscous liquid are investigated analytically by means of an asymptotic method. The effect of surface tension is included, and it is shown that thermal and acoustic damping can be accounted for by the suitable redefinition of one parameter. Approximate analytical solutions for the steady state oscillations are presented for the fundamental mode as well as for the first and second subharmonic and for the first and second harmonic. The transient behaviour is also briefly considered. The first subharmonic is studied in particular detail, and a new explanation of its connection with acoustic cavitation is proposed. The approxi- mate analytical results are compared with some numerical ones and a good agreement is found. In Part II the characteristics of subharmonic and ultraharmonic modes appearing in the forced, steady state oscillations of weakly nonlinear systems are considered from the physical, rather than mathematical, viewpoint. A simple explanation of the differences be - tween the two modes, and in particular of the threshold effect usually exhibited by subharmonic oscillations, is presented. The principal resonance in the case of weak excitation is also briefly considered. Finally, in Part III the problem of two viscous, incompressible fluids separated by a nearly spherical free surface is considered in general terms as an initial value problem to first order in the pertur- bation of the spherical symmetry.

The liquid-quenching tech- nique was used to reduce the characteristic scale of the microstructure in the alloys. It was found in some cases (notably A1-base alloys) that the superconducting transition temperature of the metallic phase was significantly enhanced (from 1.2° to ~ 6°K for A1-base alloys) as a result of liquid-quenching. The characteristic scale of the microstructure was found to be of the order of several hundred angstroms in alloys showing the greatest enhancement effect. The results are discussed in terms of recent theoretical models that pre- dict enhancement of superconductivity due to electronic interactions at a netal-semiconductor interface. The results are also analyzed in terms of the McMillan theory of superconductivity in which the enhance- ment effect is attributed to a reduction in the characteristic phonon frequencies of the metal. It is concluded that the latter explanation can account for all of the observed properties and, thus, that it is probably unnecessary to invoke an ""excitonic mechanism"" to explain the results.']"

An ordinary differential equation governing the circular mem- brane is imbedded in a family of n-dimensional nonlinear equations. Phase plane methods are used to examine the number of solutions corresponding to a parameter which generalizes the thrust, as well as other parameters determining the shape of the nonlinearity and the undeformed shape of the membrane. It is found that in any number of dimensions there exists a value of the generalized thrust for which a countable infinity of solutions exist if some of the remaining parameters are made sufficiently large. Criteria describing the number of solutions in other cases are. also given. Donnell-type equations are used to model a circular cylindrical shell. The static problem of bifurcation of buckled modes from Poisson expansion is analyzed using an iteration scheme and pertubation methods. Analysis shows that although buckling loads are usually simple eigenvalues, they may have arbitrarily large but finite multi- plicity when the ratio of the shell\'s length and circumference is rational. A numerical study of the critical buckling load for simple eigenvalues indicates that the number of waves along the axis of the deformed shell is roughly proportional to the length of the shell, suggesting the possi- bility of a ""characteristic length. "" Further numerical work indicates that initial post-buckling curves are typically steep, although the load Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Further - more, a shell may be subject to a uniform torque, even though one is not prescribed at the ends of the shell, through the interaction of two modes with the same number of circumferential waves. Finally, multiple time scale techniques are used to study the dynamic buckling of a rectangular plate as well as a circular cylindrical shell; transition to a new steady state amplitude determined by the nonlinearity is shown.

ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION Problem Solving Strategies in Learning Disabled and Normal Achieving Children by George McCrea Robson Doctor of Philosophy in Special Education University of California, Los Angeles and California State University, Los Angeles, 1977 Professor Barbara K. Keogh, Chairperson This investigation involved the ontogeny of problem solving strat- egies in learning disabled and normal achieving children. The study was focused on two processes, one having to do with aspects of categorical storage of information, the other with the use of categories in problem solving situations. Both may be relevant to academic problem solving and thus of importance to educational programming, especially for chil- dren with school achievement problems. An associative clustering test was used to measure the number of concepts stored and efficiency of their storage in categories, a twenty-questions test served as a measure of categorical retrieval and labeling in a problem solving situation, and transfer of categorical organization to new problem solving tasks was measured by a second associative clustering test and by immediate xii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Subjects were selected from upper elementary self- contained special education classrooms for learning disabled children. Normal achieving children selected as comparison subjects were enrolled in the same neighborhood schools as the learning disabled children with whom they were compared. Children composing the comparison group were matched individualy with learning disabled children on chronological age, ethnicity, sex, and where possible on IQ. On the operational measures of number of concepts stored and effi- ciency of their categorical storage, learning disabled and normal achiev- ing children performed equally. However, learning disabled children performed less adequately than normal achievers on the problem solving task designed to measure retrieval and labeling of conceptual categories. When this problem solving task was ordered categorically, the performance of learning disabled children approached that of normal achieving chil- dren, and equaled the performance of normal achievers when in-task categorical order was provided with verbal, visual and motoric cues. Operational measures of transfer of categorical organization showed no effects for categorical storage in either learning disabled or normal achieving children. On measures of immediate and delayed transfer of categorical organization to new problem solving tasks tapping retrieval of conceptual categories, learning disabled children showed significant effects as a function of in-task categorical ordering and cues. Normal achievers showed no such effects. xiv Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. These results were inferred to suggest that learning disabled children acquire and categorically store information equally with normal achieving children, but differ from normal achievers by failing to retrieve and label conceptual categories as a strategy in problem solv- ing under some circumstances. However, learning disabled children appear to approach normal achievers in the use and transfer of this strategy when the problem solving task is ordered categorically. Further, they seem to equal normal achievers in the use of categories as a strategy and in transfer effects when cues are added to the in-task categorical order. In essence, study findings suggest that learning disabled children have acquired an average amount of information and have organized it, but do not use it within the same context or in response to the same cues as the normal achiever does. Learning disa- bled children apparently require a highly structured context provided with cues if they are to use information as well as normal achieving children do. In general, then, an important implication of the findings in this study is that contexts and cues presented by standard educational assessment and programming may not be optimal for tapping learning potential and for promoting learning in children identified as learning disabled. Consequently, educators may be identifying some children as deficient learners who are simply different learners compared with normal achievers. It also follows that children labeled as learning disabled may require modes of instruction different from those that are seemingly optimal for the majority of school children. If children classified as learning disabled are simply children who learn differently XV Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Let 3(%) denote the set of bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space. For T € B(2), let o(T) and W(T) denote its spectrum and numerical range, respectively. The following are proved using von Neu- mann's theory of spectral sets: (i) If o(I) U (y,00) with Y > o and if T is not self-adjoint, then there is an index N such that {z E C : /z| whenever n > N. (ii) T1 is accretive, n = 1, 2, k, if and only if the closed sector { E C : Arg zl < x/2k} U {03 is spectral for T. In this case 11/mtx/l < tan(/2k) 1(ReIx!! for each x E N. (i) remains valid if we replace 1.2 by TP, where D is a surjective op- erator commuting with T. Various situations in which the commutativity assumption is relaxed are examined. A theorem for finite dimensional matrices by C. R. Johnson is gen- eralized to the operator case: If O & n = 1, 2, 3, , then an odd power of T is normal. Furthermore, if T is a convexoid, then T itself is normal; in fact, T is the direct sum of at most three rotated positive operators. Using these results, we prove: Let I E (%), 36 infinite dimensional and separable. If In & {y E B () : Y = AX - XA, A,X E (%), A positive}, n = 1, 2, 3, , then there is an odd integer m and a compact operator Kg such that I + Kg is normal. Moreover, T is a normal plus a compact if and only if in {c1 (W(T + K)) : K compact? is a closed polygon (possibly degenerate). Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The ambient fluid is of uniform density and non-flowing except for the flow induced by the jet. Density variations are assumed small. The equations of motion integrated across the jet have been care- fully examined and it has been found that the kinematic buoyancy flux of a heated plume and the kinematic momentum flux of a pure jet are not in general conserved. It has been proven that the flow in a two-dimensional pure jet is not self-preserving. A systematic set of experiments was carried out to examine turbulent buoyant jet behavior for a wide range of initial Richardson numbers (or densimetric Froude numbers) Values of the Richardson number, which describes the relative importance of buoyancy in a jet, extended from the value appropriate for a pure jet (zero) to that appropriate for a plume (approximately 0.6). . The buoyant jet temperature and velocity fields were measured using calibrated fast response thermistors and a Laser Doppler velocimeter respectively. The velocity and temperature data obtained were recorded magnetically in digital form and subsequently processed to extract both mean and fluctuating values of temperature and velocity. The structure of the mean flow (including the spreading rate of the mean velocity and temperature profiles, velocity and temperature distribu- tion along jet axis, and the heat flux profile), the turbulence structure Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

It was determined that the turbulent heat transfer and the turbulent intensity increase with increasing the Richardson number. The spreading rate of the transverse mean velocity and temperature profiles were found to be independent of the Richardson number. The turbulent buoyancy flux in a fully developed buoyant jet has been found to be a significant fraction (38%) of the axial buoyancy flux. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

An analysis of variance, multiple comparison of differences, t tests, and chi square tests of significance were used for determining the difference among the sample groups. Conclusions determined on the basis of the findings of this study are: 1. The test battery mean scores differentiated the salespeople groups from the nonsalespeople group signifi- cantly. 2. A test battery was developed which measures retail selling competencies of department store employees. 3. The multiple comparison test of differences among three sample groups resulted in rejecting the hypothesis of homogeneity of variance. 4. There were significant differences among the var- iances of the test scores based on the three samples. The single exception being that the distributive education salespeople did not differ from the nondistributive educa- tion salespeople significantly. Further investigation is recommended of the relation- ship between the battery and other standardized tests. More validation of the battery with other department store sales- people is also recommended. Cross validation of the norm data is needed before the battery should be used in screen- ing and certification. iv Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Embryonated eggs are voided with the feces of the host. Upon ingestion of the eggs by a suitable orthopteran intermediate host, the larvae hatch and migrate into the wall of the midgut and rectum where they develop to the infective third stage. The common field cricket, (Gryllus assimilis) was used as experimental intermediate hosts, and domestic cats ( Felis domestica) served as the experimental definitive host. The first stage of larval development was completed between the 11th and 12th days postinfection. The body of the larva was uniform in width, with a tapered, pointed tail flexed dorsally. The tooth-like spine at the anterior extremity of the body was lost between the 5th and 11th days of development. The esophagus was straight and well developed. Strands of nerve fibers made up the nerve ring. The excretory pore was visible, and slightly posterior to the nerve ring. The intestine was continuous to the anus. An anal plug was present. iii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. Development of the second stage occurred during the 13th and 14th days postinfection. The nerve ring, excretory pore, esophagus, and intestine were well developed in second-stage larvae. Third-stage larvae were first observed 15 days postinfection. The pseudolabia and teeth were developed more than in second-stage larvae. The tail was more pointed, and no longer flexed dorsally, and the anal plug was absent. Other than an overall increase in body size, no further development was observed in third-stage larvae.

Clinical signs of illness in inoculated heifers were first apparent as febrile responses to maxima of 41.2 to 42.4°C. Eleven (48%) of the animals showed biphasic temperature responses with the first peak occurring 4 to 6 hours after inoculation and the second (higher) peak occurring 12 to 24 hours post inoculation. Nine of the 23 infected heifers aborted or showed signs of impending abortion 27 to 49 days after inoculation. The abortion of 3 other heifers between the 5th and 12th post inoculation day was thought to possibly represent toxic reactions to the inocula. Scheduled euthanasia of the remaining 11 animals precluded obtaining data on the true abortion incidence. All heifers sampled later than 6 days after inoculation responded with significant increases in group-specific Chlamydia CF titers. The rise in CF titer was generally evident by 6 days post inoculation and reached a stable maximum by 8 to 9 days after inocu- lation. The 12 control animals which received placebo inoculations neither aborted nor showed significant increases in CF titers. Data obtained from attempts to culture chlamydia from the experi- mentally infected heifers showed that the EBA agent could be recovered routinely only from infected placentas. Non-placental organs of the dams (other than intestines and internal iliac lymph nodes) were evidently cleared of the infection by 7 days after inoculation.

Inconsistent isolation results were obtained from the 12 fetuses inoculated in the 2nd trimester. Cultures of these fetuses showed sporadic positive isolations spread from 5 to 49 days after inoculation. These results contrast sharply with the isolation results obtained from the 11 3rd trimester fetuses as no positive isolations were. made from these prior to 29 days after inoculation. The presence of intestinal chlamydial agents in both control and infected cattle before and after inoculation prompted studies designed to differentiate between the intestinal agent and the EBA agent. Using the complement fixation (CF) test with species-specific antigens (pre- pared from chlamydial cell walls) and rabbit antisera, complete antigenic cross reaction was seen between the intestinal isolate and the EBA agent. The finding that inoculation of the intestinal agent into a pregnant heifer resulted in abortion and the development of lesions identical to those produced with the EBA agent, supports the conclusion that the 2 agents are the same.

The procedure eliminated the DMF solvent which was used in the original synthesis reported by Bly and Mellon (8) The infrared absorption bands and the ultraviolet absorp- tion bands of Bipm were reported. Proton magnetic resonance data of 2-bromopyrimidine and Bipm dissolved in DMF and deutero- chloroform were also reported. Complexes of Bipm were prepared using the transition metal ions iron (III), cobalt(II), nickel(II) and copper (II). The complexes were prepared in a methanol-2, 2' - -dimethoxypropane solvent medium. Reaction times varied from two to five days for the Bipm-hydrated metal nitrate mixtures to produce homogeneous products. Stoich- iometric analyses showed the products to have the formulae of Mutzza, n+ and Mn n+ LA_, where M represents the metal n ion, L represents 2, 2'-bipyrimidine, and A represents the anions. The infrared and electronic absorption bands of all products were reported. The spectroscopic data, combined with the magnetic moment data and the stoichiometric analyses, were used to propose structures for the Bipm complexes. The proposed structure for the MITL3A n complexes was typical of six coordinate complexes containing tris-bidentate ligands. A Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 54 close similarity in spectroscopic data was found for the tris - - Bipm and tris-Bipy - complexes. The proposed structure for the nickel 2:3 complex had a three dimensional array of tetradentate Bipm bridges between every metal ion and its nearest neighbor. All nitrates were found to be free ions. n+ Structures for the other M2 LA complexes were difficult to pro- - pose. The proposed structure of the iron and cobalt 2:3 complexes introduced the concept of alternating sites of metal ions having two different coordination environments in the same compound. At one site a metal ion is surrounded by three Bipm molecules. At the other site the metal ion has two Bipm molecules and two monodentate nitrates also coordinated. Electronic absorption data was not able to differentiate two types of metal ions in the iron and cobalt 2:3 com- plexes. A structure for the copper 2:3 complex was not proposed, although some possible structures were refuted. All Mnt LA complexes proved to be six coordinate, although n no iron 1: 1 complex was found. The 1:1 complexes have a proposed structure involving a linear polymer chain of metal ions bridged by tetradentate Bipm molecules. Each metal ion also has two mono- dentate coordinated nitrate ions. It was not possible to predict whether the metal ions were in trans, cis or mixed configuration. The following observations of Bipm complexes can be made: (1) The Bipm ligand coordinates in both bidentate and tetradentate Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

(4) The ligand field strength of bidentate Bipm is just below Bipy, but above ethylenediamine. (5) The ligand field strength of tetradentate Bipm is less than bidentate Bipm. The Bipm ligand appears to be unique in that the 1:3 complexes of iron (III) was found to be low spin, but relatively stable to reduc- - tion. The ligand field strength of Bipm appears to be just borderline for the high to low spin transition of iron(III) in the 2:3 complex. The copper - Bipm complexes appeared to be distorted from octahedral symmetry beyond the point of typical Jahn-Teller distor - tion. The D3 distortion that the Bipm ligands imparted to the copper ions allowed the electronic absorption data, as well as the infrared data and stoichiometric analyses to assign the copper ions as six coordinate. The apparent high degree of distortion in the copper 1:1 complex gave rise to two unique phenomena in its infrared spectrum. First, a nitrate ion showed a splitting pattern indicating that it was very weakly coordinated. Second, a splitting pattern was observed in a C-H out of plane rocking band of the Bipm molecule in the copper 1: 1 complex. A correlation of the structure of the Bipm complexes and the observation of this splitting pattern indicated the cause of the splitting. The splitting appears to be caused by the Bipm molecule being exposed to a length-wise dipole field. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The way suggested should depend on the current state of input utilization and production effi- ciency. If Saudi farmers are ""poor but efficient, "" then total produc- tion cannot be increased from existing resources farmers supply and control. If there is disequilibria within the agricultural sector, how- ever, and farmers are ""poor but not efficient, "" then total production from existing resources could be increased through production econo- mic studies as well as educational programs helping farmers to recog- nize and remove disequilibria. Resource allocation efficiency in Saudi\'s agricultural sector was analyzed by constructing two production functions for wheat and barley (Cobb-Douglas type). The value marginal productivities (VMP) of land and labor were computed and allocation efficiency was investigated. The results found the VMP for land under barley was higher than that of land under wheat. VMP of land, both under wheat and barley, was much less than the marginal expense of land, however. Thus, Saudi farmers experience net losses. Resources, then, are used iii unprofitably. Moreover, the VMP of labor was very low in wheat and negative in barley production, indicating too much labor is used rela- tive to land. Production function analysis suggests disequilibria, a result of very low land-labor ratio. This ratio must be altered before the agri- cultural sector increases efficiency. Three solutions were considered. ""Labor squeeze"" and land ex- pansion (horizontally) are ruled out; intensive cultivation seemingly became the solution. Fertilizer, as a form of intensive technique, was investigated. A production function for fertilizing wheat was con- structed and the marginal rate of substitution, fertilizer for land, was constructed from different input combinations. This function was com- pared with two functions the U.A.R. produced. The results show how fertilizer can play an important role as a substitute for land. Moreover, production from existing resources can be increased by removing disequilibria. Removing the ""barriers to efficiency"" re- moves disequilibria. Some of these barriers to efficiency were mar ket structural variables, natural factors and government policies. The study found disequilibria within Saudi\'s agricultural sector. Thus, total production from the existing resources could be increased through production economics studies and educational programs. Moreover, to alter the existing unfavorable land-labor ratio, more iv land investment is required, i.e., the ""intensification"" within the agricultural sector seems the most feasible solution.

Attention is focused on similitude of systems in which an incompressible wotting fluid displaces a compressible non-wetting phase. Five criteria for similitude are recognized and discussed. Analytical and experimental techniques were used to investigate the phenomenon of infiltration as a two-phase flow problem. Approximate analytical solutions to the infiltration problem for several boundary conditions are presented. Experimental data for the infiltration into finite media are presented and discussed. Measurements of the developing capillary pressure profile during constant rate infiltration were made. An approximate analytical solution to the constant rate infiltration problem elucidates the factors which affect the time at which ponding will occur. David B.

The data were col- lected by a mail questionnaire administered to respondents from the cities and surrounding suburbs of Rochester, New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; Phoenix, Arizona; and Fresno, California. While the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents did not conform closely to the general popu- lation of these areas they were similar to those of tourists recently visiting the Rocky Mountain states. Consequently, it was postulated that the state images described in this study would be similar to those held by other individuals most likely in the tourist market for Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming. It was concluded that non-residents, from a particular region of the United States, generally perceived land, climate, population, and recreational characteristics of a state similarly. In addition, they perceived significant differences in these characteristics between states. While residents of different regions generally agreed upon the charac- teristics of a given state, such agreement was not unanimous. Coupled with the fact that different regions of the United States represent markets of different magnitude, this lack of image agreement supports the concept that state tourist promotion must be different in both quantity and content.

A center-pivot system consists of a water pipeline sus - pended in the air by means of cables or trusses and self-propelled towers. The system revolves very slowly in a circle while distributing water to the soil by means of sprinklers connected above the pipeline. Center-pivots apply water at a high rate thereby causing runoff. This study examined the potential reduction in runoff by changing the normal symmetrical application rate pattern to a front-humped non- symmetrical application rate pattern. Laboratory experiments and a model were utilized in the study. The laboratory equipment consisted of a spray bar capable of applying varying rates to eight soil plots and a drying apparatus capable of drying the soil plots between tests. The model consisted of a numerical solution to a moisture flow equation which combined Darcy's law and the continuity equation. Two 2-step patterns and one constant application rate pattern were used in laboratory tests to study the relationships between time iii and infiltration rate, between depth of intake and infiltration rate, and to help develop the numerical model. Three simulated center-pivot application rate patterns were used in laboratory tests to help determine the most desirable type of center- pivot application rate pattern as well as to verify the numerical model. The model's predicted infiltration curves fit reasonably the laboratory infiltration data. The conclusion drawn, for the differences that existed between the model and laboratory data, was that the model erred in not including soil shrinking and swelling in calculating its hydraulic conductivity values. The numerical model was extended to predict conditions beyond the conditions of the laboratory infiltration tests. Possible effects of including shrinking and swelling in the extension of model tests are suggested. A modified potential intake rate theory used to study runoff under center-pivots was tested. The advantages and disadvantages of applying this theory are delineated. Some design considerations for selecting center-pivot application rate patterns are presented with a design graph being presented for one set of physical conditions. The main conclusions drawn from the study are that a numerical moisture-flow model can be a helpful research tool and that iv non-symmetrical application rate patterns have potential for reducing runoff ten percent or more under center-pivot sprinkler systems.

The experiments were conducted in a 4 foot-deep, 5 foot-wide and 16 foot long flume at the Colorado State University Engineering Research Center. Twenty-four runs were made with bare (without vegetation) sandy soil, using six different slopes (5.7 to 40 percent) and four different rainfall intensities (1.25 to 4.60 inches per hour) Four additional runs were made with 40 percent of soil surface covered by winter wheat. In each run, the sediment yield, mean velocity of flow, water discharge and temperature were measured, and the eroded material was analyzed for grain size distribution. Flow under rainfall conditions cannot be strictly called laminar, but neither is it turbulent. The Reynolds number (afx/v) range (0 to 130) was small in these experiments. The flow was influenced by viscosity, and perturbations are damped. Flow subjected to a con- tinuous series of perturbations, however, such as under raindrop impact in this study, appears turbulent and may be called agitated laminar flow. Froude numbers ranged from 0 to 5.4; that is, flow was of the supercritical type. Momentum and continuity equations for steady, spatially varied overland flow under rainfall were derived, and boundary shear stress, T was calculated from the momentum equation with a numerical approximation. The stream power was then related to sediment yield as iii a transport model. A longitudinal mean local velocity equation for steady spatially varied overland flow in terms of friction slope, rainfall excess, length of run, viscosity, and gravitational accelera- tion was also derived and tested. Predicted velocities with this equation were comparable to the velocities measured in the experimental runs. Dimensional analysis was performed on all variables, and the data were analyzed by computer, using a nonlinear multiple regression method. Prediction equations were developed from these methods of analysis and models were tested. It was concluded that sediment transport models from dimensional analysis, data analysis and analytical approaches are similar. Velocity, slope and rainfall intensities were found to be the most important variables affecting soil erosion. In sediment transport prediction equations, the slope and Reynolds number (defined as rainfall excess times length of run divided by kinematic viscosity) are dominant parameters. As expected, soil loss in the experimental flumes was found to decrease in the presence of vegetal cover. However, the decrease in soil loss diminished with increasing rainfall intensities. Sediment yield from overland flow for laboratory conditions can be predicted by the equations developed in this study. For field conditions, the equations can be used as first approximations of soil loss due to overland flow. The numerical constant of the prediction equations would need to be modified for different soil conditions.

The first session involved the administration of the anxiety scales and training in relaxation. Session two, three and four involved the AMT treatment. AMT treat- ment involved training the subjects in controlling anxiety by having them arouse anxiety and terminate it by the use of deep muscle relax- ation. Session five involved readministering the scales and obtaining feedback from the subjects. It was predicted that AMT would be effective in significantly reducing both generalized and public speaking anxiety as compared to the waitlist control group. It was also predicted that AMT would lower the anxiety levels of the treatment groups to that of the no- problem group while the waitlist groups anxiety levels would remain unchanged. Predictions for the generalized anxiety subjects were made only with regard to the IPAT, MAS and ASCL. Predictions for the public speaking anxiety subjects were made only with regard to the PSI. Analysis of covariance designs were used to compare treatment groups to waitlist groups while analysis of variance designs were used to compare the anxiety groups to the no-problem group. For the general anxiety subjects, results showed that there were no significant differences between the general anxiety treatment group (GAT) and the general anxiety waitlist group (GAW) on the pretest scores for the scales. The generalized anxiety people (GAT + GAW) iv Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Results of the analysis of covariance comparisons on the posttests indicated a significant reduction in anxiety for the GAT on the IPAT and MAS as compared to the GAW. The ASCL total scores were not significantly reduced, but an analysis of the subscales indi- cated a significant drop in the frequency and intensity scales. However, no significant reduction was obtained in the interference subscale. For both the GAT and GAW posttest scores remained significantly higher as compared to the NPC. For the public speaking anxiety subjects, results showed that there were no significant differences between the public speaking anxiety treatment (PST) and the public speaking anxiety waitlist group (PSW) on the pretest scores for the scales. The public speaking anxiety people (PST + PSW) were significantly different from the no- problem group on the pretest scores of the PSI. Results of the analysis of covariance comparison on the posttest scores for the PSI indicated a significant reduction in anxiety for the PST as compared to the PSW. Both the PST and PSW were not significantly different from the NPC on the posttest scores for the PSI. It was concluded that AMT was effective in reducing both gene- ralized and public speaking anxiety when compared to a waitlist group.

SUBGENUS PACHYLOPHUS Evolutionary relationships of the ten species of Oenothera sub- genus Pachylophus were established on the basis of data from studies of morphology, cytology, distributions, habitat requirements and pol- lination ecology. It was found that the seven subspecies of Oenothera caespitosa Nutt., Oe. eximia A. Gray and Oe. psammophila (Nels. & Macbr. ) Stockhouse, form a closely related alliance. Ecogeographic differenti- ation and pollinator preferences have promoted evolution within this alliance. Chromosomal restructuring was minimal in the establishment of these taxa.

Gray and Oenothera psammophila (Nels. & Macbr. ) Stockhouse. Oenothera cavernae Munz and Oe. brandegeei (Munz) Raven have differentiated recently from Oe. caespitosa through habitat specializa - tion, changes to the annual growth habit and a change from allogamy to autogamy. iii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. Oenothera tubifera Seringe in DC Prodr. and Oe. muelleri Munz were more distantly related to the above alliance through Oe. macrosceles A. Gray. Oenothera tubifera was probably of recent or - igin from muelleri. Oenothera primiveris A. Gray and Oe. xylocarpa Coville were shown to be more distantly related to the Oe. caespitosa alliance. Oenothera xylocarpa appears to have originated from Oe. primiveris. Evolution within the subgenus Pachylophus has occurred within the framework of minimal chromosomal restructuring, especially when compared with the more advanced subgenera of Oenothera. Pollination ecology studies of Oenothera caespitosa and Oe. psammophila indicated that the two were ethologically isolated by hawk- - moth pollinator preferences. Intra and interpopulation gene flow were studied. Interpopulation hawkmoth flights in excess of twenty miles were documented. It was suggested that the polytypic nature of many Oe. caespitosa populations may be due to hawkmoth mediated gene flow between populations. It was also shown that intersubspecific gene flow was probably occurring. Individual flowers of Oenothera caespitosa produced on the aver - age, 35 microliters of nectar.

Two-dimensional single EID was also an effective preparatory technique for the isolation of selected antigen-antibody precipitin loops. Use of these selected precipitin loops in immunization procedures allowed production of hyperimmune antisera that were useful in comparative immunodiffusion and electro- immunodiffusion tests. Sera from verious species were simultaneously compared two at a time using 2-D Single EID. Patterns of complete and partial identities were obtained for homologous proteins possessed by all salmonid species tested. Albumins showed complete identity patterns for all species of the western North American Salmo tested. A pattern of complete identity between albumins of coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, and Yellowstone cutthroat trout, Salmo clarki lewisi, likewise confirmed the close relationship of Oncorhynchus species with the western North American Salmo. A comparison of albumins from the European brown trout, Salmo trutta, and S. clarki lewisi resulted in a pattern of partial identity with a long spur.

Transferrins may be of value in delineating relationships between rainbow and cutthroat trouts and intraspecific groups of each. An F1 hybrid (S. clarki x S. gairdneri)gave a transferrin pattern of partial identity for the S. gairdneri transferrin when reacted with an S. clarki stomias antiserum. A unique pattern of partial identity with the formation of two spurs was obtained for transferrins from golden trout, Salmo aguabonita, and S. clarki stomias. The transferrin double partial identity pattern was considered to be supporting evidence that both species were derived evolutionarily from a recent common ancestor. Transferrin polymorphisms demonstrated by agarose gels may be further resolved by using acrylamide-agarose gels, cellulose acetate- gel media, and starch gel-agarose mixtures. Caution should be exercised in analyzing molecular variation in proteins. Genetic and environmental sources of variation are discussed as well as reasons for spurious heterogeneity. Richard A.

Four types of betaine were used in this study: (1) unlabeled betaine hydrochloride, (2) betaine hydrochloride with the carboxyl 14 carbon labeled with C, (3) betaine hydrochloride with at least one 14 of the methyl-group labeled with C, and betaine hydrochloride with 15 N. The data showed that betaine metabolism was reduced as the energy level of the ration increased. On the low-energy ration, 42.13 per cent of the added betaine was metabolized as compared to 21.83 for the high-energy ration. The wo-dimensional paper chromatography failed to detect any radioactivity in glycine by scintillation counting and failed to detect any amino acids by scanning the whole sheet on a radiochromatogram scanner. A possible explanation could be that the glycine being syn- thesized was the only metabolized compound present and it was quickly metabolized to ammonia and acetic acid. iii The data showed that ammonia was being synthesized from the 15 15 N-betaine. This N-ammonia could be formed from glycine as hypothesized. The labeled carboxyl group of betaine was found only in acetic 14 acid. The per cent of ;activity that disappeared from the carboxyl labeled betaine that was recovered as acetic acid was 24.37 and 68.34 for low-energy and high-energy rations, respectively. The radioactivity from the 14 C labeled methyl groups of betaine was found in trimethylamine, carbon dioxide, and methane. These compounds accounted for 15.3, 4.19, and 19.67 per cent of the 14 C- activity that disappeared from the methyl-labeled betaine. The synthesis of methane indicated that demethylation of betaine was occurring. The pathway by which the carbon dioxide was formed was not determined. This study failed to prove conclusively that betaine was de- methylated to glycine which was in turn metabolized to ammonia and acetic acid, but added support to the probability of this pathway.

The majority of community comparisons have been concerned with competitive interactions of closely related species, however ecologi- cal similarity need not reflect close taxonomic relationships. The guild concept was used in this study as a technique for comparative community studies. The guild is a functional category combining species that overlap significantly in their ecological requirements, but differ slightly in methods of extracting their requisites. This study's objectives were to determine habitat exploitation patterns of Horned Larks (Eremophila alpestris), Lark Buntings (Calamospiza melanocorys), McCown's Longspurs (Calcarius mccownii), and Chestnut-collared Longspurs (Calcarius ornatus); and to isolate methods used to minimize competitive interactions between these species. Because the four species do exploit the same habitat in simi- lar ways, they qualify for guild membership--the - ground-foraging guild. Parameters of habitat exploitation of this guild were investigated on the Pawnee National Grassland in northcentral Colorado from 1970 iii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Time budget analysis, catalogs of how and where individuals spend their time, was used to quantify adaptive relationships found in the guild. Measures of habitat features and vegetation structure associated with guild members were made at 20 randomly-selected, 10.2 ha plots. Areas occupied by guild members differed significantly in the cover- age of shortgrass, midgrass, sedges and exposed soil. In part, these habitat differences resulted from nest-site requirements of the four species. Lark Buntings and Chestnut-collared Longspurs nested in close association with midgrasses and shrubs. Interspecific associa- tion analysis indicated that McCown's Longspurs and Horned Larks, and hestnut-collared Longspurs and Lark Buntings were significantly (P<<.01) associated with each other, while the two longspurs were significantly (P < .01) disassociated. Temporal segregation was accomplished by guild members con- centrating nesting at slightly different times of the breeding season. In 1971, Horned Larks initiated most (78%) of their nests in April and May with a nesting peak during the week of 2 May. The nesting peak of McCown's Longspurs was 2 weeks behind that of Horned Larks. Lark Bunting nesting peaks occurred during late May and early June. No recognizable nesting peak was found in Chestnut-collared Long- spurs. Temporal overlap for the entire breeding season was lowest between Horned Larks and McCown's Longspurs, species highly iv Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. associated spatially; and between Horned Larks and Lark Buntings, the two most abundant species during the breeding season. Species not spatially associated had high degrees of temporal overlap. Foods fed to nestlings were used as an index of food specializa- tion occurring within the guild. Orthopterans formed the buld of nestling diet for Lark Buntings, Chestnut-collared and McCown's Longspurs. Coleopteran were of major importance in nestling Horned Lark diet. Mean prey item length of nestling Lark Buntings was sig- nificantly (P < . 05) larger than average items of other guild members. An average diurnal diet returned to nestlings by males, and dietary overlap within the guild are also described. Differences in the fre- quency that various food items were procured also contributed to efficient habitat utilization. The use of the guild concept in analysis of community structuring in the shortgrass prairie indicates that habitat partitioning is achieved through combinations of adjustments and divergences in use of time, space and food; and species coexistence results from a complex of compromises serving to reduce the intensity of competition between species exploiting the same habitat.

The investigator gathered general and demographic information from a limited sample of teachers as well as information about the types of innovative ideas and methods employed by the teachers. Analysis of variance was used to test any significant differences between factors identified by the Instructor's Recordkeeping Inventory (IRI) and student achievement scores, identified by the Recordkeeping Achievement Inventory (RAI). . Since the investigation was limited in scope in terms of not having a large random sample, the investigator had to rely on teachers who were willing to participate in this exploratory type of study in a course in recordkeeping. Consequently the investigator found that a variety of teacher factors made no significant impact on student achievement including years of teaching experience, years iii of salaried work experience, years of teaching recordkeeping and percent of time devoted to teaching recordkeeping. However, the investigator did find a significant positive relationship between the frequency of adoption of innovative ideas and methods by the teacher and student achievement. The students indicated that the teachers who employed classroom assignments, job simulation and their own work experiences made more of an impact on student career choice than counseling and career tests. Since the investigator's conclusions were limited to the teachers and their students identified in the study, further research is recommended employing a more rigorous design in determining the population so any further results may be more conclusive.

The use of natural resources aimed at achieving our growth and development goals has often led to intrusions into nature's fragile aquatic habitats. Specific cases of total habitat destruction and elimination throughout the Unites States that are due to man's intrusions into the water environments are all too numer- ous, while the damage has been greatest in the areas of heavy population concentrations, no state has been free from these intrusions into the aquatice habitats. This study provides answers to questions concerning: (1) what is being done to protect the aquatic habitats, and (2) why it is being done, with specific reference to non-market concerns and values. The study employs a legal-economic framework for the analysis. The focus of the study is upon state laws and policies that will pro- tect, preserve or have an otherwise desirable impact upon the aquatic hab- itats. Two bodies of law are identified as being most relevant. They are: (1) traditional water law doctrines, and (2) conservation laws. Provisions found within the various state water law doctrines fre- quently have a degrading effect upon the aquatic habitats. Specific atten- tion is given to the biological and economic impact and implications of the beneficial and reasonable use provisions. ii Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

These laws are: (1) wild and scenic rivers; (2) stream preservation and encroach- ment; (3) highway construction; (4) dam construction; (5) marsh, estuary and wetlands; and (6) state environmental policy and protection laws. The study views the legal and economic systems as being related in both form and content. Both are subject to change. As individuals place new demands upon the legal-economic institutions, either new norms are created or there is a change in the existing body of rules and laws. In response to the growing concern over the loss of aquatic habitats, and based upon the existing body of state laws and their economic implications, the study proposes policy recommendations intended to further protect and preserve the remaining aquatic habitats.

This complex, multi-layered structural system consists of jcists acting in incomplete composite and two-way behavior with one or more layers of sheathing. This physical system is simulated by a crossing-beam model consisting of a perpendicular set of T-beams and sheathing strips in developing the mathematical model. To allow the use of ordinary beam theory in evaluating the behavior of the T-beam elements, the effective flange width of the incomplete composite sheathing elements was required. An essential part of this study was the derivation and quantification of the effec- tive flange width for a wide variety of parameters. Two solution techniques are presented for the mathematical model, a finite difference method and a more versatile finite element pro- cedure. Methods are developed to evaluate the effect of gaps in the sheathing layers and the results of the effective flange width study are utilized in the theoretical solutions. A total of twenty-two full-scale floor tests are conducted as part of an experimental program to provide the necessary data for verification of the mathematical model.

The verified mathematical model was used to evaluate extreme cases to assess individual effects of composite and two-way action of wood joist floors.

The verified model provides the basis for future development of improved design criteria for wood joist structural systems.

The theory is developed using Bernoulli-Euler assumptions with additional developments to account for the interlayer move- ment. The development is general, in the small deflection sense, for beams with mechanical connections. The development leads to governing equations for beams having both dual and single axes of symmetry and an arbi- trary number of layers. Solutions to the governing equa- tions are presented in closed form for various sets of boundary conditions. These solutions show the effect of interlayer connection on the natural frequency, and it is shown that the solutions reduce to well known values for the extremes of interlayer connection. The effect of damping on the solutions is presented, and the equations for the damped system are solved for small damping. The results of some simple tests which were performed are presented, and these results are shown to agree favor- ably with the proposed theory.

A questionnaire, composed of 115 items covering seven categor- - ies of automobile repair, was designed and sent to a random sample of auto technicians, service managers and auto mechanic teachers. The direction gained from this questionnaire was used to develop 116 questions covering information in the areas of repair which was con- sidered most important to future auto mechanic teachers. This ""trial examination was mailed to a random sample of service managers, auto technicians, vocational and industrial arts auto mechanic teachers, and sophomore, post-secondary vocational auto mechanic students. These participants were asked to answer and critique each of the 116 questions. An item analysis was made on each of the questions. This analysis, combined with the critiques, provided the basis for eliminat- ing and/or rewording many of the questions before the final form of the examination was developed. iii The 88 question final form of the examination was sent to a ran - dom sample of individuals from the same groups involved in the trial examination with the exception of service managers. For correlation purposes, a personal data sheet from each participant and a rating form from his immediate supervisor were obtained. Correlations between the total and sub-test scores and ratings were computed for all participants combined. These correlations indi- cated that the total examination was a better predictor of a person\'s performance than any of the sub-tests. Analysis of variance (AOV) was made between all four groups of participants combined, industrial arts and vocational teachers, and technicians and vocational teachers on total examination scores. In addition, an AOV between technicians and between technicians and voc- ational teachers on length of time at their jobs was computed. In all cases, a significant difference was found to exist between groups on total examination scores. However the data revealed no significant difference due to the length of service and no significant interactions. Measures of central tendency were computed for each group of participants individually and collectively. An expectancy table was constructed as a guide to be used when evaluating an individual\'s trade competency and/or experience. William J.
